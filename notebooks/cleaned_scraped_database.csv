For more detailed state-by-state information on expungement, please click here or click on the map above.
An expungement is a court order that removes something from your criminal record. Expungement gives you the opportunity to have all court and arrest records sealed so that they cannot be seen by future employers. If your record is expunged, you do not have to tell an employer that you have a criminal record. You would also be able to apply for jobs that people with criminal records are not eligible to apply for. Click on the links below to learn more about expungement in your state and resources available to help you apply for expungement.

Some states have resources available to help individuals get expungements without needing to pay for an attorney. See below for information on these resources in your state.

Expungement Of Criminal Offenses In Michigan

What is an expungement?
Michigan Law has long provided that individuals convicted of most state criminal offenses could be expunged or set aside, under certain circumstances and if certain pre-conditions are met. Offenses that could not be expunged or set-aside included offenses like murder, criminal sexual conduct or any traffic offense. When a record is expunged or set aside it no longer becomes accessible to public records so employers and others cannot locate them, however, the records are still accessible in a non-public record which is available to law enforcement agencies.
Big changes to the Expungement Laws took place in 2021 when the Clean Slate Act went into effect. The Clean Slate Act expands on the types and numbers of offenses that can be expunged and will eventually provide for the “automatic” expungement of certain convictions without the need for anyone to affirmatively petition or apply to the convicting court for such an action.
With the expansion of the Expungement Laws, it is believed that hundreds of thousands, in not millions, of people are now eligible for their records to be expunged. In 2021 the amount of expungement petitions filed were over two times the amount of the preceding year. The Attorney General's role in the expungement is to determine whether an applicant is statutorily eligible to have the conviction(s) expunged from their record.
Expungement Process: What to Expect
""expungement"" written on laptop blue screen in white font
An expungement is a way to remove past offenses from your public record. Expansions under the “Clean Slate” laws include eligibility for up to three felonies and unlimited misdemeanors, excluding certain assault or weapons offenses and felonies that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.

The Open Meetings Act (OMA) took effect January 1, 1977. In enacting the OMA, the Legislature promoted a new era in governmental accountability and fostered openness in government to enhance responsible decision making.1 Nothing in the OMA prohibits a public body from adopting an ordinance, resolution, rule, or charter provision that requires a greater degree of openness relative to public body meetings than the standards provided for in the OMA. 2

Applications and Checklists
Is the formal title of an applicant's pleading seeking expungement of a criminal offense in the State of Michigan.
These are Michigan crimes that include:
an element of assault (e.g., murder, attempted murder, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault with intent to commit great bodily harm less than murder);
kidnapping;
prisoner taking hostage;
threats against an employee of the Family Independence Agency;
manslaughter;
stalking;
criminal sexual conduct (rape violations);
armed robbery;
unarmed robbery;
carjacking; or
terrorism violations.
A complete list of assaultive offenses can be found in MCL 770.9a(3).
Is a judgment entered by a court upon a plea of guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere, or upon a jury verdict or court finding that a defendant is guilty or guilty but mentally ill. See MCL 780.621a(a).
Another word for the act of setting aside a conviction, meaning that a public record of the conviction is no longer available to members of the public including employers and anyone going to the Internet Criminal History Access Tool (ICHAT) maintained by the Michigan State Police.
Any state crime punishable by imprisonment in the state prison system (e.g., the Michigan Department of Corrections).
Offenses punishable by up to a maximum of life imprisonment include, but are not limited to, the following offenses or attempts to commit these offenses:
first-degree arson;
arson of insured property with the intent to defraud the insurer;
assault with intent to commit murder;
torture;
assault with intent to rob while armed;
attempted murder (by poisoning, drowning, strangling, or any other means not constituting assault with intent to murder);
first-degree child abuse;
solicitation to commit murder;
send or deliver explosives, causing serious impairment/death;
placement of explosive, causing serious impairment/death;
intentional discharge of firearm from motor vehicle, snowmobile or off-road vehicle, causing death;
intentional discharge of firearm at dwelling or occupied structure, causing death;
first-degree murder;
second-degree murder;
delivery of certain schedule 1 or 2 controlled substances, causing death;
prisoner taking a hostage;
perjury in a capital case;
human trafficking involving kidnapping/attempt, first-degree criminal sexual conduct/attempt, or an attempt to kill, or death;
first-degree criminal sexual conduct;
armed robbery; or
carjacking.
Again, this is not a complete list of all felonies in Michigan for which life imprisonment is possible. Please consult the Michigan Penal Code and/or the conviction documents in your case to determine if the felony you are seeking to expunge is a life offense.
Any state crime that is not a felony (e.g., not punishable by imprisonment in the state prison system, but rather is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail system or is not punishable by imprisonment, but by a fine or other penalty).
A record that is kept by the Michigan State Police and is accessible to courts, police agencies, and prosecutors (including the Attorney General) for the purposes listed in MCL 780.623(2), but which is not available to members of the public including current or potential employers.
This refers to the agency that prosecuted the case leading to the conviction at issue. Depending on the circumstance, it could be a county prosecutor’s office, a city/village attorney’s office, or the Attorney General.
These are Michigan misdemeanors that include the following crimes:
assault and battery;
aggravated assault;
domestic violence;
aggravated domestic violation;
illegal entry;
fourth-degree child abuse;
contributing to the delinquency of a minor;
using the internet to make a prohibited communication;
intentionally aiming a firearm without malice;
discharge of a firearm intentionally aimed at a person;
discharge of an intentionally aimed firearm resulting in injury;
indecent exposure;
injuring a worker in a work zone;
leaving the scene of a personal injury accident;
operating while impaired offenses , if the violation involves an accident resulting in damage to another individual’s property or physical injury or death to another individual;
selling or furnishing alcoholic liquor to an individual under 21 years of age, if the violation results in physical injury or death to any individual; or
A violation of a local ordinance substantially corresponding to any of these violations.
A complete list of serious misdemeanors can be found in MCL 780.811(1)(a).
Any offense that is a violation of the Michigan Vehicle Code or of a local ordinance substantially corresponding to that act, which violation involves the operation of a motor vehicle and at the time of the violation is a felony or misdemeanor. See MCL 780.621a(b).

Expungements allow you to seal your court record or arrest record. This prevents the public from having access to the information.
A Section 18 expungement allows a person to expunge their entire arrest record. A Section 991(c) expungement allows a person who received a deferred sentence to expunge their plea, and have the disposition of their case updated to show the case has been dismissed. The disposition will say, “pled not guilty, case dismissed”. However, a 991(c) expungement will not expunge (remove) the arrest record.
Expunging your court record is free. Expunging your arrest record requires paying a $150 processing fee. It may also require fees be paid to local law enforcement agencies expunging their records. The OSBI accepts cashier’s checks or money orders. Personal checks WILL NOT be accepted.
There are specific paperwork, notice, and legal requirements necessary in order to successfully petition for an expungement of your arrest records. The OSBI strongly suggests you get a lawyer to advise you of the proper actions to take. If you decide to represent yourself, the court will hold you to the same standards for knowing and following the applicable law as it would an attorney.
Anyone qualified under the applicable statute can file the paperwork necessary to begin the expungement process.
When you send the OSBI your Petition for Expungement or an Order of Dismissal and/or Expungement you should include the following information in order to successfully complete your expungement: The OSBI needs to know your name, social security number, date of birth, the crimes that you were charged with, the date of your arrest, and the disposition (end result) of your arrest and/or charges in court.
If domestic-related charges occurred, please provide a police narrative or report that states the relationship to the victim so it does not cause a delay in processing your expungement. This includes the following:
21.644.1
DOMESTIC ABUSE WITH PRIOR PATTERN OF PHYSICAL ABUSE
21.644.A
ASSAULT
21.644.B
ASSAULT AND BATTERY

22.60.6.B
PROTECTIVE ORDER VIOLATION RESULTING IN PHYSICAL INJURY
Multiple arrests in the same county can be filed for in one petition, however, a separate petition must be filed for each county where a person has records they want expunged.
After receiving a certified copy of the order, expungement of court records can take about one month after the OSBI receives the order, expungement of arrest records usually takes a similar amount of time after receipt of the order and the required fee.
The OSBI cannot pre-approve someone for expungement. However, the statutory categories for people who are eligible for expungement are listed in Title 22 of the Oklahoma Statutes, in section 18(A). View the Expungement pamphlet.
No. If a person is eligible for expungement, the age of the record will not disqualify them.
Yes. Even if a person qualifies for expungement, the State can object to an expungement being granted.
Yes.
No. Your record can be checked by sending in a request to the OSBI
No. Expungements do not allow destruction of physical records. Additionally, identifying information, including fingerprints may still be maintained by the OSBI by law. Such identifying information, however, will not reference or be attached to the sealed arrest information.
See Oklahoma Statutes Title 22 § 18 & Title 22 § 19; Title 22 § 991c.

About
What is an expunction?
An expunction is a legal process to remove a criminal conviction or a criminal charge from a person’s record and to seal or destroy the state’s records of the arrest, charge, and/or conviction. A person who has had an expunction granted generally cannot be found guilty of perjury if he or she denies that the arrest, charge, or conviction ever happened. However, an expunction might not provide relief from all consequences of the charge or conviction; for example, an expunction might not prevent the expunged case from being used for federal immigration decisions. You can view the statute (law) that describes the effects of expunctions here and the statutes under which expunged information can be accessed here and here.
North Carolina also allows the expunction of certain records of juvenile delinquency, but that process is different from expunction of adult criminal charges and convictions. You can read more about juvenile expunction in the Juvenile Delinquency Help Topic.
What is the difference between an “expunction” and “expungement”?
“Expunction” and “expungement” mean the same thing. North Carolina’s expunction statutes use both terms interchangeably.
Who is eligible for an expunction?
There are numerous expunction statutes in North Carolina. Some allow the expunction of only specific types of offenses, like drug possession. Other statutes allow expunction of a broader range of offenses but for a smaller group of people, like persons who were under 18 or 21 at the time of the offense. Still others depend on how the charge ended; for example, there are statutes that address expunction of convictions and statutes that address expunction of charges that were dismissed or for which the defendant was found not guilty. The table below lists the statutes that govern expunction, their titles (which describe briefly the kinds of cases eligible for expunction under that statute) and provides links to the Administrative Office of the Courts’ petition forms and instruction sheets for each type of expunction. The full text of these statutes is available here.
Statute (N.C.G.S.) Records to Which Statute Applies
15A-145(a) Misdemeanor convictions
15A-145.1 Gang offenses
15A-145.2(a) Drug offenses dismissed after conditional discharge under G.S. 90-96(a) or (a1)
15A-145.2(b) Drug offenses, dismissed or defendant acquitted
15A-145.2(c) Drug or drug paraphernalia convictions
15A-145.3(a) Toxic vapors offenses dismissed after conditional discharge under G.S. 90-113.14(a) or (a1)
15A-145.3(b) Toxic vapors or drug paraphernalia offenses, dismissed or defendant acquitted
15A-145.3(c) Toxic vapors convictions
15A-145.4 Nonviolent felony under age 18
15A-145.5 Nonviolent felony(ies)
15A-145.5 Nonviolent misdemeanor(s)
15A-145.6 Prostitution offenses
15A-146(a) or 15A-146(a1) Criminal charge (or alcohol infraction before 12/1/1999),dismissed not pursuant to deferred prosecution or conditional discharge (effective 12/1/2014)
15A-146(a) or 15A-146(a1) Criminal charge (or alcohol infraction before 12/1/1999),dismissed pursuant to deferred prosecution or conditional discharge (effective 12/1/2014)
15A-146(a2) Criminal charge (or alcohol infraction before 12/1/1999), with finding of not guilty or not responsible
15A-147(a) Identity Theft - not guilty dismissal or charge set aside by court
15A-147(a1) Dismissal of charges resulting from identity theft or mistaken identification
15A-148 DNA records upon appellate reversal of conviction or upon pardon of innocence
15A-149 Conviction after pardon of innocence
What if I have more than one conviction?
Some expunction statutes allow for the expunction of multiple charges or convictions, but others do not. And sometimes, one charge in a case might be eligible for expunction, while a different charge in the same case is not. An attorney can advise you about your eligibility for expunction of multiple charges or convictions.
When can I file for an expunction?
Some of the expunction statutes allow you to petition the court for expunction almost immediately after the case is over, for example, when the charges all are dismissed. Others require waiting periods, like a number of years or upon the completion of any sentence (including the final expiration of a period of probation or post-release supervision/parole). Each statute listed in the table above describes the waiting period or conditions that must be met before petitioning for expunction under that statute. If you have questions about the waiting period or your eligibility under a particular statute, you should consult an attorney for advice.
What if I am eligible for more than one type of expunction?
For some charges and convictions, it is possible that more than one expunction statute might apply. However, there are different advantages and disadvantages to petitioning under one statute versus another. For example, if you are granted an expunction under certain statutes, that expunction will bar you from receiving a future expunction under other statutes. Other expunction statutes don’t impose that bar and therefore might be a better choice for filing your petition. If you think that you may be eligible for expunction under more than one statute, you should contact an attorney for advice and assistance.
Where can I find more resources about expunctions?
You can find additional information, including information about eligibility requirements, from the University of North Carolina School of Government.
Filing for an Expunction
How can I file for an expunction?
You can find the necessary forms online. Links to the petition forms for each type of expunction (and generally an instruction sheet for each petition) are provided in the table above. Some expunctions require additional documents, such as affidavits of good character from people who know you; when required for a particular expunction, those additional documents are covered in the instruction sheets.
Where should I file for an expunction?
A petition for expunction should be filed with the clerk of court in the county where you were charged or convicted.
What is the process for filing for an expunction?
The exact process is slightly different for each expunction statute. The general process is covered on the instruction sheet for each petition. Note that there might be some local differences in procedure from one county to the next, so the clerk of superior court can tell you if there are any local practices for steps like obtaining a judge’s signature for requesting criminal record checks (required for several types of expunction) or scheduling a hearing.
Do I have to pay to file for an expunction?
There is generally a $175 filing fee to petition for expunction. A few expunction statutes do not require a fee, like expunction of charges that were dismissed or ended in a “not guilty” verdict, unless the dismissal was based on the completion of a diversion program or deferred prosecution agreement. If you cannot afford to pay the fee, you can ask to file without paying the fee by using this form.
Will I have to testify in court?
For some expunctions, the judge will hold a hearing to determine whether you have “good character.” For other types of expunctions, such as expunctions of dismissed charges, the judge might decide without a hearing, based on a review of your record. The clerk of court can tell you any local procedures for scheduling a hearing.
How long does the expunction process take?
Expunctions may take several months, depending on the time required for criminal record checks and to schedule a hearing.
What can I do if my expunction was denied?
In some cases, you may be able to appeal the court’s decision. You should contact an attorney as soon as possible, if you are considering an appeal, because there might be a short deadline in which to do so.
What if I am still seeing information about my charge or conviction after my expunction was granted?
If information regarding your charge or conviction is still available through North Carolina court system sources a few weeks after your expunction is granted, you can contact the clerk of court’s office for the county where the expunction was granted. If information is available through private sources, such as websites that compile criminal record information, you will have to contact those sources directly with information about your expunction. An expunction does not automatically remove information about the charge or conviction from all private sources.
Will I receive a copy of my expunction order? Can I get a copy at a later date?
When a judge signs an expunction order, the clerk of court will provide you with a copy of the order. You cannot get a copy of an order granting an expunction later because the clerk of court and other government entities receiving notice of the expunction destroy all files related to the criminal process, including the expunction order itself. If your expunction petition was filed on or after December 1, 2017, you can request a certificate verifying a prior expunction. You can make the request of the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts by mail using this form, but you will need to swear to the application on that form before a notary or court official authorized to administer oaths before sending it to the AOC. You may also use eCourts Guide & File for the application.
Legal Representation
Do I need an attorney to file for an expunction?
You can file for an expunction on your own, but an attorney can help you by assessing your eligibility, making sure you include all necessary documents, guiding you through the process, and representing you in a hearing, if needed. Court officials, such as judges and clerks of court, cannot provide you with legal advice about your eligibility. If you represent yourself in court, you will be expected to follow the same rules of procedure and evidence as a licensed attorney.
Can I get a court-appointed attorney to help me with an expunction?
No, court-appointed attorneys are not available to help with expunctions.
How can I find an attorney to help me with an expunction?
Legal Aid of North Carolina is a statewide nonprofit organization that assists some people with expunction cases. You can apply for Legal Aid representation by calling 1-866-219-5262 or by applying online. See the Finding an Attorney Help Topic for additional organizations that assist with expunctions and information about hiring a private attorney.

File Request to Expunge a Criminal Record
You can restrict public access to your criminal records.
Certain criminal history records can be hidden or sealed from the public. People with a records restriction are able to apply for jobs, housing, or licenses without their record appearing on a background check. Your criminal record will not be permanently deleted or destroyed and will still be available to judicial officials and criminal justice agencies.
Arrests that qualify for restriction include, but are not limited to, cases that are closed without conviction and certain misdemeanors.
The process to restrict your records depends on the date of your arrest and which agency or prosecuting attorney processed your case. If your arrest occurred before July 1, 2013, the arresting agency needs to process your request. If your arrest occurred on or after July 1, 2013, contact the prosecuting attorney’s office directly. The prosecuting attorney may be an Attorney General, a district attorney, or the solicitor-general.
Approved requests for records restrictions must be submitted to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s Georgia Crime Information Center (GCIC) in order for the arrest to be removed from your public record.
You may wish to consult a lawyer before submitting a records restriction request. You can find a lawyer through the State Bar of Georgia.
HOW DO I …
Expunge a Criminal Record?
Get Prepared
The process for how to apply for a records restriction may vary by county. Contact the arresting agency or the prosecuting attorney’s office for more information about how to submit a request, required fees, and additional paperwork.
You may want to request a copy of your criminal history order to gather important information about what is on your record, including the arresting agency and arrest date. You can request a copy from your local Sheriff’s office or police department.
Gather What You’ll Need
Request to Restrict Arrest Record form (if arrest is prior to July 1, 2013) or form provided by the prosecuting attorney's office (if arrest is on or after July 1, 2013)
Method of payment. The arresting agency or prosecuting attorney’s office may charge fees of up to $50 to process the request. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s Georgia Crime Information Center (GCIC) also requires a fee to process the records restriction in their state database.
Additional paperwork. The arresting agency or the prosecuting attorney’s office may want additional documentation, including a copy of your criminal history or a certified copy of the court’s final disposition of your case.
Apply to Restrict Your Criminal Record
The process to restrict your records depends on when your arrest took place and which agency or prosecuting attorney processed your case.
Arrests Before July 1, 2013
Arrests On or After July 1, 2013
Restrict Your Records
If your request is approved, the prosecuting attorney will submit the complete application to the Georgia Crime Information Center database.
If the prosecutor approves your request but doesn’t have access to the GCIC database, you will need to send the approved application and processing fee to the GCIC yourself. The processing fee can be paid by money order or certified check payable to “Georgia Bureau of Investigation.” See a list of GCIC fees.
Mail the completed application and payment to:
Georgia Crime Information Center Record Restrictions
P.O. Box 370808
Decatur, Georgia 30037-0808
If the prosecutor denies your request, you can appeal the decision to the Superior Court of that county within 30 days.
Next Steps
GCIC usually processes complete record restriction applications within 2-3 weeks. You will receive a letter of completion in the mail confirming that the arrest has been restricted in the law enforcement database. Please keep a copy of this letter for your records. If you don’t receive a notification, call GCIC for an update on your application’s status.

FIX YOUR RECORD / SEALING AND EXPUNGEMENT / EXPUNGEMENT / LOUISIANA- EXPUNGEMENT
Louisiana- Expungement
What is Expungement?
Expungement deletes your criminal record and restores you to the status you had before the offense. The state removes the record from all official sources, but it does not destroy the record. Louisiana keeps a confidential file of expunged records that only judges, law enforcement, and some state licensing agencies may see. Employers, landlords, and banks will not see an expunged record.
Who is Eligible for Expungement?
In general, you are eligible to have a record expunged if the charges were dismissed, you were found not guilty, or you were convicted of a nonviolent misdemeanor or felony. If you are eligible for expungement under Louisiana law, it is mandatory that the court must grant it.
If you want to expunge a conviction, the offense that you were convicted of cannot be any of the following:
A violent crime;
A sex crime;
Distribution of controlled dangerous substances;
Misdemeanor domestic abuse battery;
Misdemeanor stalking; or
A crime against a minor.
And all of the following must be true:
You have no other convictions, other than traffic citations;
You do not have any charges pending against you;
You have paid all fines and restitution; and
You have waited the appropriate time period after you completed your sentence including any type of supervision to apply for expungement.
If you are uncertain whether you are eligible for expungement, it may be smart to consult an attorney.
What Effect Does Expungement Have?
Once a Louisiana court grants an expungement, the court orders all state agencies to remove (not destroy) their records. Your conviction, dismissal, or acquittal is erased. In most cases, you can legally deny being arrested or convicted.
State licensing boards for healthcare, financial positions, social work, childcare, law, and other jobs can still see expunged records. Louisiana law requires them to keep the records confidential. Law enforcement agencies must submit written requests to see expunged records. Other agencies or employers can see expunged records only by showing ""good cause"" and getting a court order.
If you apply for a state issued professional license, a law enforcement job, or some school jobs, or you apply for a firearm permit or a concealed-carry permit, you must disclose your record and the expungement.
When Can I Apply for Expungement?
You can apply for expungement of a conviction only after you have completed your sentence. You must wait several years from whatever date is the most recent such as the date of conviction, completion of sentence, or completion of probation or parole.
If your conviction is for a misdemeanor, you must wait five years. You may not have any felony convictions during those five years and no pending felony charges. You can expunge one misdemeanor conviction every 15 years and one DUI conviction every 10 years.
If your conviction is for a felony, you must wait 10 years. You may not have other convictions or pending charges. You can usually expunge one felony conviction every 15 years.
You may file for expungement immediately if you were arrested but not prosecuted such as the charges were formally dismissed, a motion to quash was granted, or you were acquitted.
If the prosecutor did not act, the time limit to bring prosecution must run out before you can file for expungement. For felonies punishable by imprisonment ""at hard labor,"" you must wait six years. For all other felonies, you must wait four years. For misdemeanors punishable by fine or imprisonment, you must wait two years. For misdemeanors punishable only by fines such as traffic infractions, you must wait six months to file for expungement.
How Do I Apply for Expungement?
Here are the six steps to apply for expungement:
Get the correct forms. To access the forms that all Louisiana courts use, visit the Louisiana Clerks of Court Association website here: Expungement Forms Index. You can also find forms on the Louisiana State Bar Association's Legal Education and Assistance Program (LEAP) website here: Law Library of Louisiana. The Justice and Accountability Center (JAC) also has forms that courts use in different regions of Louisiana. To access the forms, visit the Justice and Accountability Center for Louisiana's website here: Justice and Accountability Center of Louisiana. Click on ""How-to Guides and Forms"" for links.
Complete the required forms and collect the necessary documents. Some courts require additional forms and certified copies of records to complete the expungement applications. Check with your parish court clerk.
File your petition for expungement with the court clerk. Include all the required documents and forms including your criminal record. You must get a copy of your criminal record from the state of Louisiana within 30 days of filing your expungement petition.
Pay the $550 fee. The amount covers fees paid to the Louisiana State Police's (LSP) Bureau of Criminal Identification and Information, the court, the parish DA, and the parish sheriff. Certain situations may require additional fees, bringing the total cost to about $700. The fees are not refundable, even if you do not receive an expungement. The fees generally cannot be waived, except if all of the following are true:
You have no other felony convictions anywhere in the U.S.;
You have no pending felony charges;
Your offense ended in an acquittal, a successful motion to quash, a dismissal, or the prosecutor's refusal to pursue the case, and the time limit for prosecution has expired.
If you qualify for this fee waiver, you must submit the ""Certification for Fee Waiver"" form to the parish DA. The DA must consent to the waiver. Submit the form with the DA's signature when you file your petition for expungement. To access the Certification for Fee Waiver form, visit the Louisiana Clerks of Court Association website here: Expungement Forms Index. The form is number four.
Wait about 60 days after you file for any response. Since expungement is mandatory if you qualify, you may not get a hearing. In that case, you will wait 30 to 60 more days to receive your expungement ""Certificate of Compliance"" from the LSP. This means the LSP have complied with a court order and removed your record. If someone objects to your eligibility such as the DA or a victim, you will have a court hearing. It will take an additional 30 days to get the hearing.
Notify any private background check companies about your expungement. Louisiana law requires it. You must send each company a certified copy of the expungement order by certified mail. Once a background check company receives this notice of expungement, the law prohibits it from giving out the expunged record.
More Information About Expungement
To access the ""How to Handle Your Expungement"" guide, visit the Justice and Accountability Center (JAC) for Louisiana's website here: How to Handle Your Expungement. The JAC also offers an expungement app called ""Clean Jacket."" The app is helpful in determining your eligibility for expungement. To download the app for free, visit Google Play, iTunes, or the JAC website here: JAC Newsletter.

Learn to build healthy savings habits through a CEO staff member narrated video and a sample budgeting worksheet
WHY SAVE MONEY?
Saving money allows you to have financial flexibility down the line in case of an emergency or to pay for your future needs (housing, children, transportation, vacations, etc.). When you have consistent income, it is always important to put some of the money away in a savings account where it can’t be touched (except during emergencies). This video, narrated by Jose Lara Cruz, the Outreach Specialist, overviews seven easy steps to develop healthy savings habits.
STEP ONE: RECORD EXPENSES
The first step to successfully saving money is to track your spending habits. That means anything you spend money on from groceries to rent payments. You could organize it by categories to track spending by week or by month. Moreover, it may be helpful to organize your expenses into two categories, variable (expenses that change) and fixed (expenses that don’t change). Once you have an idea about what you spend on everything monthly, you can create a budget. ​
STEP TWO: CREATE A BUDGET
In order to successfully create a budget, you must know how much is coming in (income) versus how much is going out (expenses). In general, you should try to put away between 10 and 15 percent of your income. Refer to this Budget to access a sample budgeting worksheet.
STEP THREE: CUTTING SPENDING
You should start by looking at the variable expenses accrued each month. Some strategies to cut back include: eating out less and cooking more, canceling unnecessary subscriptions that renew each month, and attending inexpensive entertainment options (free concerts, street fairs, etc.). In order to save on fixed expenses, think about changing things like your cell phone carrier or health care plan.
STEP FOUR: SHORT AND LONG TERM SPENDING GOALS
To create healthy savings habits, it is a good idea to start by putting between 1 and 5 percent of your monthly income into a savings account. This is a good first step and if you feel you are able to deposit more into savings, feel free to do so. ​
STEP FIVE: CHOOSE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT
To continue creating healthy savings habits, it is important to open a separate savings account that holds ‘untouchable’ funds. Often times, banks will require a minimum deposit in a savings account to open the account. For example, if you open a savings account with Bank of America, you will need an initial deposit of $500 to open the account. If you end up removing funds from the savings account and dip below the required amount, the bank may charge you a fee.
STEP SIX: AUTOMATIC SAVINGS DEPOSITS
Setting up automatic transfers between your checking and savings accounts is one of the easiest ways to begin saving money. You can choose what portion of your paycheck is sent to your savings account. The easiest way to set this up is to create an online account with your bank, either through the banking app or on a computer.
STEP SEVEN: TRACK SAVINGS
Once you have set up your savings account and automatic savings deposits, you can continually check your savings account to see how much money you have accumulated.

Below is an overview of how to understand a sample paycheck and a video introduction to filling out a W-4
SAMPLE PAYCHECK
Source: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Looking over your paycheck can be a difficult and confusing endeavor. Money is taken out of your paycheck for tax purposes and gross and net pay are different numbers. This section aims to help you understand your paycheck so you are better equipped to question paycheck issues if they arise. Each section has a corresponding number (1-9) and is explained below.
1. PAY PERIOD
Many employers will pay you once every two weeks. If you are unsure about your pay schedule, you should ask your employer. In addition, the pay date, located at the top right of the sample paycheck, is the date you should be paid for your pay period. ​
2. GROSS WAGES
Gross wages represent how much you would be paid if deductions were not taken out (numbers 4-7). If you are not on salary and work for an hourly wage, you will see your pay per hour below ‘rate’ and the hours you worked during the pay period under ‘hours’.
3. YTD GROSS
YTD Gross or Year to Date Gross is the amount of money you have earned during the year before deductions.
4. FEDERAL TAXES
Federal taxes are deducted for the federal income tax so that you are not sent a hefty tax bill when April comes around. You may be eligible for a tax return when taxes are due in April.
5. FICA SOCIAL SECURITY TAX
FICA SS tax (5) is taken out to pay your portion of Social Security. Social Security is deducted to pay for benefits for disabled and retired individuals.
6. FICA MEDICARE TAX
The FICA Medicare taxes are deductions to pay for the cost of MediCare, which is a federal health insurance program for adults aged 65 or older and individuals with disabilities.
7. STATE TAXES
State Taxes are taken out of your paycheck to pay the state income tax. Like the federal income tax, this deduction lowers your tax bill in April.
8. DEDUCTIONS
Deductions represent all the taxes taken out of your paycheck and will show the total amount. As you can see in the net pay, the gross wage of 200 minus the 44.67 in deductions equals your net pay of 155.33 (take home pay).
9. NET PAY
Net Pay is the amount of money that you will take home (Gross wages minus deductions).
HOW TO FILL OUT W-4
This video, created by the Federal Reserve, provides a walk through of filling out a W-4 form. If you have further questions, please reach out to a CEO staff member or consult a certified financial professional.

FILING TAXES IS IMPORTANT
Filing federal and state taxes can be complicated and costly; however, it is important and legally required. It creates a record of your income, which is important when you apply for an apartment or a loan. You may also be eligible for a tax refund. You can claim a refund up to three years later. This page will provide a list of resources to help you file taxes for free and where you can locate free tax filing sites near you.

TIPS TO BANK WITH CONFIDENCE
WHICH BANK IS RIGHT FOR YOU?
Location is one of the most important aspects of joining a bank. Do you want a bank that is walking distance or one that you can drive to? When thinking about what bank is right for you, it is important to keep in mind the location of the bank and its' ATMs, what kind of account you are looking to open, and what services will be offered to you. Pictured above is a screenshot of CEO's Oakland location in Google Maps with a variety of banks situated around it. Additionally, you can search credit unions in Google Maps on your mobile device or on a computer to find those that are in your area.
OPENING A CHECKING ACCOUNT
Explore a bank's webpage and navigate to checking account options or set up an appointment with a bank teller
EXPLORE ACCOUNT OPTIONS
Most banks have a variety of checking account options to choose from
FEES AND REQUIREMENTS
Pay attention to the monthly fees and account requirements
SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT
If you have questions, schedule an in-person appointment either online or on the phone
OPENING A SAVINGS ACCOUNT
In order to open a savings account, you are going to want to choose a reputable bank, as most banks offer a savings account option. Once you have chosen a bank, you will want to choose a savings account option that is right for you. If you have questions regarding the specifics of the account, be sure to call the bank to obtain more information. You will need a few things to open a savings account: full name, social security number, birth date, street address, and transfer of funds information (if applicable). Often times, the bank will require you to maintain a minimum balance in the account or will ask for an initial deposit. It is important to abide by the minimum deposit or you may be charged additional fees.
BANK FEES AND HOW TO AVOID THEM
OVERDRAFT FEES
How do I avoid this fee?
Check your balance regularly
Install the Mobile Banking app on your smartphone and turn on low balance alerts (via text)
Having Overdraft protection can link your the overdrafted account to other accounts to cover the overdraft fee (and the fee will often times be lower)
What are Overdraft Fees?
Fees that occur when you withdraw more money than you have in your account
Range in the $30-40 range
Your account balance will dip into the negatives
MINIMUM BALANCE FEES
What are Minimum Balance Fees?
If you have a checking or savings account, many banks will charge you a fee for having an open checking or savings account
Charges range between $5 and $25 per month
If you keep the minimum balance required in the account, most banks will waive the monthly fee
Continually check your balance online to ensure you will not go below the minimum
Install low balance alerts via text on the mobile banking app
ATM FEES
What are ATM Fees?
Search your bank on Google Maps to find out where your closest ATM is
If you are near your bank’s ATM, it may be a good idea to withdraw a large amount of cash to avoid continually withdrawing from other ATM providers
These are fees that occur when you withdraw money from your account at ATM’s that are not your home bank (for example, using a Bank of America debit card at a corner store ATM)
You can be charged both a fee from your bank and a fee from the ATM provider
Fees can range from $2 to $8
CHEXSYSTEMS
What is ChexSystems
ChexSystems is a verification service used to determine whether your application for a bank account is denied. A ChexSystems Report, (also known as a Consumer Disclosure Report), contains information regarding the misuse and fraudulent account activities. It contains a listing of your past overdrafts, any accounts banks have closed on your behalf, and more. The information contained in the report may or may not directly impact your credit score.
Addressing your ChexSystems Report
Request a free copy of your report via telephone or online
https://www.chexsystems.com
1-800-428-9623
Check your report for accuracy
Dispute or settle
Reach out to the original creditor, and pay owed amount
Once paid, request the original creditor remove the item from your report
Making sure your name is not in ChexSystems is a key factor in building your credit.
TIPS FOR USING A DEBIT CARD
WHY A DEBIT CARD?
Now that you have a debit card, it is important that you know how to use the card. The card is tied directly to a checking account, so unlike a credit card, you are paying for the transaction right away and money is taken out of your account. If you are concerned with accumulating debt on a credit card, a debit card is a good option.
ACCOUNT BALANCE
You need to know your account balance and how much available money you have (to avoid overdraft fees). You can check your balance online or by going to your bank’s ATM and checking the balance. (*NOTE: if you are checking your balance on your Skylight Card, make sure to do it online. If you check it at an ATM, it will charge you a fee for checking your balance).
TRANSACTION HISTORY
Keep track of transactions that you make. You should check your transaction history weekly to ensure that you don’t have any phony activity on your card.
4 DIGIT PIN
You should never give out your PIN code to anyone. When creating a PIN for your debit card, avoid using numbers like your birthday or address. Choose something that you will remember, but that wouldn’t be relatively obvious.
SPENDING AND WITHDRAWING LIMITS
Many banking institutions have limits on debit cards, which could include spending or withdrawing. If you are unsure what those might be/if they apply to you, it is a good idea to call your bank. Sometimes banks will lock your card and cause it to decline if you have exceeded your withdrawal or spending limit.
FRAUD
When you encounter fraudulent activity on your card, you should let your bank know immediately. They will refund all transactions that you did not make. Federal law requires financial institutions to refund all losses within 10 business days of notification. You also have a right to dispute purchases if you see them on your transaction history. The bank will often reimburse you for the dispute.
YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT
ENROLL IN ONLINE AND MOBILE BANKING
Why should I enroll in mobile and online banking?
How do I sign up for online and mobile banking?
You gain access to a variety of services including:
Transaction history
Balance check
Security and Fraud alerts
Locking cards if lost/stolen
Depositing checks online
Go to your bank’s website and search for online/mobile banking
You will need to create a username and password online to sign up
Sign up online and then download your mobile banking app on your smartphone
SIGN UP FOR DIRECT DEPOSIT
What is Direct Deposit?
How do I sign up for Direct Deposit?
Direct Deposit allows you to receive paychecks from your employer straight to your bank account - this avoids any paper check issues, which can be lost or stolen
You will need two items to sign up for direct deposit, your account number and routing number - these can be found on your mobile banking app or online
Once you have located both of these numbers, you can use your bank's direct deposit form or this generic form to fill out the information for your employer (only if they have not given you a form to fill out)
The generic form is located here: https://eforms.com/direct-deposit-authorization/
AUTOMATIC TRANSFERS AND PAYMENTS
What are Automatic Transfers and how can I sign up?
What are Automatic Payments and how can I sign up?
Automatic Transfers allow you to transfer money automatically at a certain date each month from your checking to savings account
You can set up this feature to deposit a certain amount depending on how much money you have in your checking account - for more information, go online or call your bank
Automatic Payments can help you pay bills on a recurring schedule so that you don’t have to worry about paying them every month
To sign up for this feature, you should search automatic payments on your bank’s website or call your bank to find out more information
SETTING UP ALERTS
What kinds of alerts are available for my checking account?
How do I sign up for alerts?
Alerts that are available to you include (which can all be sent to your phone):
Low balance alerts - every time your money drops below a certain amount
Mobile deposit alerts - every time you deposit checks on your phone
Fraudulent Activity - every time suspicious activity occurs on your account
Purchase Alerts - every time you make a purchase
Overdraft Alerts - every time you overdraft your account (you should do this even if you have overdraft protection)
Log in online on your bank’s website to your account
Search ‘alerts’ or ‘sign up for alerts’
From there, you should be able to enter your mobile number to request alerts via text

money_management,scams-and-identity-theft,,,page_content.txt,/Users/ligealocal/Desktop/J-Notebooks/PathwayPal ChatBot/scraped_data/money_management/scams-and-identity-theft/page_content.txt,"DEALING WITH SCAMS AND IDENTITY THEFT
Scams are on all forms of media and can be very intrusive. Calls from 1-800 numbers, fake ads on websites, and phishy emails can all lure people into sending money to unknown sources that are trying to take your money. Here are some tips to avoid scams and different scams to look out for.
TIPS FOR DEALING WITH SCAMS
On all of your social media accounts, make sure your account is private and only accept requests of people that you know personally.
Do not include your whole birthday because it can be used to steal your identity. If you really want to put it on your profile, only include the day and month, not the year.
If you see an ad or receive a message explaining how you can make quick and easy money, it is most likely a scam. The best thing to do is ignore and delete it.
Anyone on social media that asks for your account or any sensitive information should not be trusted. If they are being particularly intrusive, you always have the opportunity to report them to the social media host.
Never trust any call that sounds too good to be true, asks for your account information/bank information, is demanding payments, etc.
If someone is promising a romantic experience and asking for payments, do not believe them. This is a scam and you should report it to the social media platform.
SCAMS TO LOOK OUT FOR
CRAIGSLIST JOBS
There are many good legitimate jobs advertised on Craigslist but be sure to look out for these warning signs of scams when responding to job ads:
Do not send personal information (Social Security number, bank account number, etc.)
Verify information in ad, keep track of who you speak to
Let someone know where you’re going, if you attend in-person interview.
SOCIAL MEDIA
Ads are the easiest way for social media scammers to make their money. They will post ads that look similar to other companies and often offer some type of service. If you click on an ad, it will take you to another page that may have the appearance of a legitimate website.
PHISHING SCAMS
What is phishing? Phishing is usually a two-part scam involving an email or text message containing links to a fraudulent website requesting sensitive information such as username, password, and account details. Once obtained, your personal and financial information can be used to access your account and steal money.
PHISHING EMAILS
Phishing emails are becoming harder to tell from real emails. By impersonating a company’s communications, these emails tend to use clever and compelling language, such as an urgent need for you to update your information or communicate with you for your security. To spot a phishing email, look for a combination of red flags. In this example, notice:
Email address: The email address of the sender does not include the domain name or it does match the 'reply to' email address.
Urgent call to action: The email includes an urgent request in the subject line and message copy, such as “for your protection and for security reasons.” Phishing emails may also contain extra spacing or unusual punctuation in addition to other red flags.
Suspicious URL: The email contains a link to a URL, which could be a fraudulent website. If you’re using a laptop or desktop computer, you can check a link’s URL by hovering over it with your cursor, and the URL will show in your browser window.
PHISHING TEXTS
Phishing texts use similar techniques as phishing emails: a sense of urgency to secure your account or verify your identity, using words like “blocked,” “deactivated”, or “for your protection” to describe your account status. These texts may prompt you to call a phone number, click on a link, or respond directly with personal or account information. To spot a phishing text, look for a combination of red flags. In this example, notice:
Suspicious sender: The text was sent by an unknown phone number.
Unusual text treatments: The text message contains a combination of unusual text treatments, including all caps, arrows, ID numbers, and an exclamation point.
Unprompted request: The request to unlock a block or verify the recipient’s identity was unprompted.
IDENTITY THEFT
The consequences of Identity Theft can be incredibly traumatic and can leave a long lasting effect on your credit. Thieves can take money from your accounts and open new credit card accounts. Here are some steps of what to do if your identity is stolen and how you can protect yourself from identity theft.
STEPS TO TAKE IF YOUR IDENTITY IS STOLEN
Contact Fraud Department of Credit Bureaus
You should request a fraud alert, which will have no effect on your credit score. You can also request a security freeze which will prevent credit issuers from accessing your credit files so that those trying to steal your identity cannot open new credit cards or loans
Reach Out to Banks
Contact any banks that you have created accounts with. You can report your identity theft to them and they will send you replacement cards with new account numbers. If you were issued a checkbook and some of your checks were stolen, you can ask the bank to stop the payment.
PROTECTING YOURSELF FROM IDENTITY THEFT
SAFELY NAVIGATE THE INTERNET
Do not share social security numbers, credit card numbers, or any other sensitive information online. When you are checking your email, if you see any spam looking emails that are requesting personal information, delete them.
GET RID OF FINANCIAL RECORDS
You should destroy any personal financial information that is in paper copy (financial statements, ATM/debit card transaction receipts, etc.)
PROTECT YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
Never carry your social security card unless it is absolutely necessary. Identity thieves can use your social security number to open fake accounts under your name and access your credit. Try to memorize your social security number if you can.
MONITOR FRAUD
Continuously check your credit report to monitor fraudulent activity. Check annualcreditreport.com to get a free copy from each of the three credit bureaus.
PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION
Never give out your personal information unless you believe the source is trustworthy.

Tips and Strategies to Stay On Top of Your Finances
BUDGET WORKSHEET
Fill out a budgeting worksheet to figure out where you can cut back spending. Use the hyperlink above to begin filling out all of your monthly spending.
WHY BUDGET?
Emergencies
Paying down debts
Short-term goals: ​Things that you save for might include a security deposit for a new apartment or a vacation
Saving for retirement
Education
SMART GOALS
Make sure your financial goals for the future are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Sensitive
BUDGETING IN SIX STEPS
HOW TO BEGIN
To effectively budget and secure a financially stable future, it is important to start by creating a budget. This will reduce your money stress and will allow you to add up how much extra income you will have per month, how much you can put into savings, and how much your combined payments will be at the end of the month. Here are six tips to help you budget for the future.
1. THINK ABOUT YOUR VALUES AND GOALS
Making a budget isn’t just about adding up how much you make and taking out what you spend. It helps to start with what you need to live and what you would like to make you happy and secure. What are you working for? Family? A better place to live? Paying bills on time every month? Each of these goals requires that you save a certain amount of money. So decide what you value and what you are working for is the first step.
2. DETERMINING YOUR MONTHLY INCOME
Determine what your total monthly income is including all the jobs you have, any money that you may be getting in gifts and/or from family, income from your spouse, and any other assistance payments like SNAP. If you are not exactly sure what your monthly income is, you should refer to your paycheck.
3. DETERMINING WHAT YOUR EXPENSES ARE
Every single thing you spend money on counts toward your expenses. Rent, utilities, groceries, debt, fast food, and purchasing clothing all should be budgeted into your monthly expenses.
4. PLAN TO SAVE AND CUT COSTS
How much do you want to save month to month? What are things you can cut from what you spend? What savings tools (coupons, signing up for SNAP if you are income eligible and buying on sale products) can you use to lower your monthly expenses? If you can put away 5 to 10 dollars a day from your daily crew pay, it will add up to a large amount in a short time.
5. KEEP TRACK OF YOUR EXPENSES
Make sure you are regularly writing down or checking your bank statement so you know how much you are spending. Within many mobile banking apps, you can set up an expense tracker that will allow you to see how much money you are spending in different categories. If you are taking cash out of an ATM, you could write down notes on your phone to track what you are spending the money on.
6. ADJUST BUDGET AS NEEDED
Keep track of your progress and if you are having trouble sticking to your budget, please don’t hesitate to reach out to CEO staff for help.

Credit is your financial reputation. It determines how much people are willing to lend you and your ability to buy something over time. Below are strategies and information about how to build your credit in a calculated way.
​CREDIT SCORES AND REPORTS
This video provides information about credit, ways to effectively build credit, and what to do when you are eligible for a credit card. If you specific questions about your own credit that isn't addressed, please consult a CEO staff member or a certified professional.
WHAT IS A CREDIT SCORE?
A credit score is a grade that is given to your credit report. It represents how well you have managed your financial obligations. The scores range from 300 to 850. The higher the score, the better the credit and the lower the risk for the lender. ​The scores are made up of 5 main factors: Payment History, Account Balances, Credit History Length, Types of Credit (student loans, credit cards, mortgage payments), and Credit Inquiries.
WHAT IS A CREDIT REPORT?
A credit report is a detailed report of your credit history. The three credit bureaus (Experian, Transunion, and Equifax) all collect the information for the reports. You can obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the credit bureaus without your credit score taking a hit using the link: www.annualcreditreport.com. ​
WHY IS GOOD CREDIT IMPORTANT?
It reduces your cost of borrowing money
It increases the amount you can borrow (never borrow more than you need)
You will need good credit to rent or buy a house
Your employer may request a credit check if you are a prospective employee
WHO CAN REQUEST YOUR CREDIT REPORT?
BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS
Banks and Credit Unions need your credit report to assess your ability to pay off debt and eligibility for credit cards.
INSURANCE COMPANIES
Insurance Companies will check your credit report to see your ability to pay off debt and to assess whether to provide you with a loan.
LANDLORDS AND EMPLOYERS
Landlords will look over your credit report to decide whether you will be a responsible tenant. Employers can ask for your written consent to review your credit report.
STEPS TO BUILDING CREDIT
Check your reports for errors or evidence of identity theft using this guide from Experian and this Checklist
Fix any errors by filing a dispute with the credit bureau(s) - they must respond within 30 days
Experian dispute form
Transunion dispute form
Equifax dispute form
Start to build credit in a responsible way
Five Ways to Build credit responsibly
Do’s and Don’ts ​
WHAT IS A SECURED CREDIT CARD AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
A secured credit card allows an individual to rebuild their credit if they have either no credit or damaged credit. The banking institution takes a deposit (or collateral) and this becomes the established credit line (the amount of money you cannot exceed per month). For example, if you put down $500, then you will not be able to exceed that amount per month. If you exceed the credit line or cannot pay back the monthly amount, the banking institution can keep your deposit, so make sure you are able to make your monthly payment. Additionally, reviews on your payments are checked periodically, so if you are in good standing, you may qualify for an unsecured credit card.
WHAT IS A CREDIT BUILDING LOAN AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
A credit-building loan is similar to a secured credit card in that they both help you build credit and use collateral to ensure on-time payments. You have to be able to afford the amount that you would like lended to you, meaning you have to put down that money up front in order to qualify for the loan. You also have to provide a source of income in order to qualify. If you make payments on time and in full, you will qualify for an unsecured loan. If you have a payment that is more than 30 days late, it will seriously impact your credit score, so make sure you have money to pay off the monthly payment.
WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I AM ELIGIBLE FOR AN UNSECURED CREDIT CARD?
When you are eligible for a credit card, you should pay attention to what your credit line is. You should never be paying more than 30 percent of your line. For example, if your credit line is $1,000, you should not be charging your credit card more than $300 every month. In addition, you should always pay your bill on time and in full. If you pay the minimum payment, the credit card company can charge you interest, which could force you to pay hundreds of dollars extra in the long run. Monitor your account activity regularly online and on your phone to check your balance and any suspicious activity. Lastly, call your credit card company right away if you experience any suspicious activity on your account.

digital_skills,,,,video_2_transcript.txt,/Users/ligealocal/Desktop/J-Notebooks/PathwayPal ChatBot/scraped_data/digital_skills/video_2_transcript.txt,"Every computer has its own set of buttons and ports. In this video, we're going to talk about some of the most common ones, including what they're for and how to recognize them. Some buttons are universal, like the power button. Depending on the type of computer you have, it may be on the front, on the back behind the screen, or even on the inside when you open the lid. The power socket is where you'll connect the power cord. If you have a laptop, you'll have a charging port instead. Most computers provide more than one USB port, so you can plug in any device you might need. Keyboards, printers, and USB drives are all common examples. Some computers even have USB-C ports, which can be used for many different things, not just plugging in devices. Laptops, for instance, often use the format for the charging port. If you have a desktop, you'll use the monitor port to connect the monitor. There are quite a few types of monitor connections, ranging from HDMI to the USB-C style we just mentioned. If you have a laptop, you can connect a separate monitor as long as you have the right equipment. Just look for the display port and plug in the appropriate cable. The Ethernet port lets you connect to the internet if you're not using Wi-Fi. All you need is an Ethernet cable, which you can then connect to your modem or router. If your computer has an audio jack, you can use it to plug in wired headphones or speakers. You may or may not have a disk drive, depending on how old your computer is and who makes it. The disk drive can be used to insert a CD, a DVD, or a Blu-ray disk. If you have ports that look like this, they're for older peripherals like mice, keyboards, and printers. Newer versions of these devices usually connect via USB or wirelessly. That covers the basics of buttons and ports. Of course, every computer is different and technology is always changing. To find out what options you have, take a closer look at your computer. G-C-F Global Creating opportunities for a better life.",False,,

In this video, we're going to show you what these parts are and what they're used for, starting with a standard desktop model. The computer case holds the main components of the computer. This is where the actual processing happens. Today, most cases are what we call tower cases, which means they stand up vertically, but they can also come in other shapes and sizes. To view things on your computer, you'll need a monitor. The monitor uses the video processor inside your computer case to display images, text, and other content. Most monitors have an LCD or LED display, both of which are very thin so they don't take up much space. All in one models are even more compact, since they combine the monitor and the computer case into a single unit. To interact with your computer, you'll need a keyboard and a mouse. Keyboards come in many different styles, including wireless and ergonomic. The mouse is used to control the mouse pointer on this screen, so you can click and interact with your computer. Most mice detect movement using an optical sensor on the bottom. Underneath, you'll find a small electronic guy. Labtops combine all of these things into one, that includes the components that are normally inside the computer case, plus a built-in screen, keyboard, and touchpad. The touchpad is a small touch-sensitive area that takes the place of a traditional mouse. It lets you control the mouse pointer using a dry motion with your finger. Labtops offer the best of both worlds when it comes to portability. You can use them on the go thanks to the built-in battery, or you can connect a separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse, effectively turning your laptop into a desktop.

It doesn't speak Spanish, or Swedish, or Chinese. It speaks in ones and zeros. You can't communicate directly with your computer, but that's where your operating system comes in. The operating system, or OS, is the program that lets you interact with your computer. Together, the operating system and computer hardware form a complete system that determines what your computer can do. There are many different operating systems. Two of the most common ones are Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. Windows comes pre-loaded on most personal computers. While Mac OS runs on all new Macs. Operating systems aren't just for desktop and laptop computers. Mobile devices run mobile operating systems, like Apple iOS or Google Android, which are designed for interactions with smaller touch screens. Before downloading a new program or application, be aware that it may not be available for your operating system. Some applications work on all devices, while others only work on certain ones. So get to know your operating system to see how it works and what it can do. GCF Global. Creating opportunities for a better life.",False,,

Do you suffer from frequent aches and pains? Looks like you could use some help with ergonomics. Ergonomics is a big subject, but basically it's about you and the things that you can do to make your workspace more comfortable. As strange as it sounds, sitting at a desk all day is actually very hard on your body, but if you arrange your workspace with ergonomics in mind, you can avoid things like eye strain and neck and back pain. Here are some tips to help you stay safe, comfortable, and productive all day long. Keyboard position is important when you're typing, your wrist should be straight and relaxed to avoid any strain. If you do start to fill any wrist pain, you might want to look into certain products that can give you extra support. For example, an ergonomic keyboard. Next, raise and lower your chair so that your wrists are in the correct position. If your feet no longer reach the floor, you can find a footrest. When you're in your chair, you should be sitting in a natural, comfortable position. Try to avoid hunching or sitting too straight. Many office chairs are adjustable in design to give you extra support in places where you need it, like the lower back. Take the time to learn how your chair works. Your monitor should be a comfortable distance away from your eyes, somewhere between 20-40 inches, or about an arm's length. The top of the screen should be about eye level, but this may vary depending on the size of the monitor. If you are working from a laptop, consider purchasing an external mouse and keyboard. That way, you can still place your screen at the proper distance and height, while still being able to type comfortably. Adjust the screen brightness on your monitor so that it matches your surroundings. If you're looking at your screen and it feels like you're looking into a bright light, it's too bright. If it looks dark and murky, it's too dim. Some monitors also allow you to change the color so that the screen emits less blue light. This feature might be called night mode or night shift, and some people find that it greatly reduces eye strain. Another way to avoid strain and fatigue is to take frequent breaks. For example, look away from your monitor every once in a while. 2020 is a good rule to follow. Every 20 minutes, focus your eyes on an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds. You can even download apps that will remind you when it's time to take a break. It's also important to get up and move every hour or so. Look around, have a snack. Whatever it takes to avoid sitting in the same position for too long. Even if you work at a standing desk, it's still important to move every now and then. Clutter is another common problem, and it can lead to strainer injury if you're not careful. In some cases, like loose power cords, it can even be a tripping hazard. If you have paperwork or supplies that can be put away, it's best to store them somewhere else instead of leaving them on your desk. Let's review. Sitting at a desk all day is surprisingly hard work, but a little attention to ergonomics will help you stay safe, comfortable, and productive all day long.",False,,

Depending on how you plan to use it, the answer may be yes. In this video, we'll look at some of the ways that a laptop is different from a desktop to help you decide. The biggest difference is portability. Laptops have to be small and light so that you can pick them up and take them with you. Since all of the basic parts are built in, setting up a laptop is as easy as opening it. The downside is that the monitor is usually smaller than a desktop monitor, so you'll have less screen space. Another important difference is that laptops use a battery. The battery can provide power to the laptop when you're on the go, and it will recharge whenever it's plugged in. An added benefit of having a battery is if the power goes out, the battery can work as a backup power source. Instead of a mouse, laptops usually have a built-in touchpad, also known as a trackpad. You can control the pointer on the screen by using a drawing motion with your finger. If you haven't used a touchpad before, the experience is a little bit different from using a mouse, and it may take a while to get used to. If you're buying a desktop computer, you can mix and match almost any monitor, keyboard, and mouse that you want. With a laptop, you won't have quite as much freedom since everything is built in. However, if you want to have the best of both worlds, you can use your laptop's ports to connect a separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse, basically turning your laptop into a desktop. And of course, whenever you want to, you can simply disconnect everything and take your laptop with you. As you can see, there are some important differences between laptops and desktops, so depending on your preferences, you can decide which one best suits your needs.",False,,

We trust them to keep our information safe, including our files and personal data. That's why it's important to protect your computer and do your best to keep it running smoothly. Here are some tips that can help. One of the biggest threats to computer safety is malware. Malware is any type of software that's designed to damage your computer or gain unauthorized access to your personal info. This can include viruses, spyware, Trojan horses and other malicious software. Windows computers, Macs and even Chromebooks can get malware. To protect your computer, you should use an antivirus program like Kaspersky, Norton or the built-in Windows 64-bit. This helps prevent viruses from being installed and also lets you scan your computer and remove any viruses that are found. Keep in mind, no antivirus program is perfect. To stay safe, you should still avoid suspicious looking ads or downloads. Run regular updates to your antivirus program and also run updates to your operating system. To keep your computer running smoothly, the latest version of Windows offers a couple useful features, including storage sense and defragment and optimized drives. You can access both of these in settings or you can find them using the search bar. When you turn it on, storage sense helps you free up space on your hard drive by scanning for temporary files and other files that can be deleted. Once on, it will run automatically in the background. Older versions of Windows offer a similar feature called disk cleanup. The fragment and optimized drives rearranges the data on your hard drive to help your computer run faster and more efficiently. It should be running automatically on a weekly basis, but you can easily check or change the schedule anytime. If something bad does happen to your computer, you could lose all of your important files. To prevent this, you should back up your computer regularly. One option is to buy an external hard drive and copy your files to it. To make this process even easier, you can use software like Windows Backup or Time Machine if you're using a Mac. Of course, if something happens to your computer and your backup drive, you'll still lose all of your files. For more security, you can use an online backup service, like iDrive or Carbonite. You may have to pay a monthly fee to use these services, but the advantage is that your files will stay safe in the cloud, no matter what happens to your computer. Following these tips can help you protect your computer and keep your information safe. You can rest easy knowing that all of your files will be there when you need them.",False,,

But what exactly do they do? Let's take a look inside and learn about the various components that make a computer work. Whether it's a desktop computer or a laptop, every computer has a large circuit board called a motherboard. This contains some of the most important parts of the computer, such as the CPU, also known as the central processing unit or processor. The CPU can be considered the brain of the computer, because it processes information and carries out commands. Since it tends to get hot, it's covered by a piece of metal called a heat sink, which draws heat away from the processor. The motherboard also contains the computer's RAM or random access memory. This is the short-term memory that the computer uses whenever it's performing calculations. However, you cannot store your files there, because the RAM is cleared when you shut off the computer. The hard drive provides long-term storage, keeping all of the computer's data even when it's turned off. Many hard drives use a magnetic platter to store data, but many newer computers have solid state drives, which are faster and more durable, but also more expensive. On many desktop computers, the motherboard has expansion slots that allow you to upgrade by adding expansion cards. You can add a video card to get better graphics performance, or you can add a wireless card to connect to your wireless home network. Most laptops, however, don't have expansion slots. Of course, the computer's components need electricity to run. The power supply unit is designed to take power from the wall outlet and send it to all of the different components that need power. Laptops also contain a built-in battery that lets you use them anywhere. A computer is a pretty complex machine, but now that you've seen what goes on inside, it should be a little less mysterious.

digital_skills,,,,video_15_transcript.txt,/Users/ligealocal/Desktop/J-Notebooks/PathwayPal ChatBot/scraped_data/digital_skills/video_15_transcript.txt,"It's important to keep your computer clean. Not just because it looks nice, but because things like dust and dirt can affect your computer's performance. But there's a right way and a wrong way to do it. We're going to show you the right way to clean your computer. First, turn off or unplug any item before you clean it, just to be safe. To clean your keyboard, turn it upside down and gently shake to remove any dirt crumbs or other debris. You can also use a can of compressed air to really get between the keys. To clean the surface, use a cotton cloth or Q-tip that's been moistened with rubbing alcohol. Never pour alcohol or any other liquid directly onto your keyboard. If you spill something by accident, don't panic. Turn off or unplug the keyboard, then leave it upside down to drain. If you're dealing with a laptop spill, shut down completely and follow the same steps. Modern mice don't require much cleaning because they don't have a lot of moving parts. Just keep an eye on the sensor underneath. If anything gets stuck here, even a tiny piece of dust, it can keep your mouse from working smoothly. When cleaning your screen, avoid household cleaners like Windex and disinfectant wipes. But also, never spray the screen directly. It can leak inside and damage the components. The safest method is to shut down or unplug your computer, then wipe the screen with a cotton or microfiber cloth. For heavier cleaning, moisten the cloth with water. For outer surfaces like the case and monitor housing, it's okay to use glass cleaner. You can also make your own cleaning solution by mixing equal parts vinegar and water. Just remember not to spray your equipment directly. Spray a cloth or paper towel first, then gently wipe. Don't forget to check the back of your case, which can get pretty dusty. If you see any build up in the ventilation fans, use a can of compressed air to clean them out. Finally, pay attention to airflow around your computer. That means no books, no clutter, nothing that might block the ventilation fans, which are designed to keep your computer from overheating. If you have a fanless computer, it's best to have airflow around the entire unit. A clean computer is a happy computer. Remember to clean your computer regularly and it's sure to stay healthy for years to come.",False,,

From laptop computers to smartphones to smart watches, they're changing the way that we live our lives. But have you ever asked yourself, what exactly is a computer? A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information or data. The computer sees data as ones in zeros, but it knows how to combine them into much more complex things, such as a photo, movie, website, game, and much more. Computers use a combination of hardware and software. Hardware is any physical part of the computer, which includes the internal components and the external parts like the monitor in keyboard. Hardware is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do, such as a web browser, media player, or word processor. When most people say, computer, they're talking about a personal computer. This can be a desktop computer or a laptop, which has basically the same capabilities, but in a more portable package. Personal computers come in a few different styles. The most common type uses the Windows operating system. Macs or Macintosh computers feature the Mac OS operating system, while Chromebooks run on Chrome OS. Smartphones and other mobile devices mostly use the iOS or Android operating systems. We'll talk more about operating systems in a later video. Computers come in many other shapes and sizes. TVs, game consoles, and even appliances like refrigerators can have built-in computers, although they may not do everything a desktop or a laptop can. There's another type of computer that plays an important role in our lives. Servers A server sends information to other computers on a network. In fact, every time you use the internet, web servers deliver the webpages that you want to see to your computer. Servers are also used in many offices to store and share files.

If you are just getting started with OS X, learning how to navigate the interface is a great place to start. First, we're going to take a look around at the desktop, which is the screen you see here. It includes a desktop background, also known as your wallpaper, the menu bar at the top, and the dock at the bottom. The dock is where you'll find shortcuts to some of the folders and applications on your computer. For example, iTunes, Safari, and Finder. To open any of the items on your dock, just click the icon. There are actually several different ways that you can navigate to files, folders, and apps in OS X. The Finder feature is one of them. We'll talk more about how to use the Finder later though. For now, I'm going to close the window by clicking the red button in the upper left corner. Let's check out Launchpad instead, which you can also find on your dock. As you can see, Launchpad gives you access to all of your applications at once, making it easier to find and access the programs on your computer. To open a program, click the one you want. Exiting Applications is just as easy. Let's zoom in on the menu bar so you can see how it works. To exit an application, click the name of the app in the upper left corner. Then choose Quit from the menu. Also on the menu bar is the Apple icon. This gives you access to your system preferences, recent files, folders, apps, and much more. You'll also use the Apple icon whenever you want to restart or shut down your computer. On the right side of the menu bar, you'll find an icon that looks like a magnifying glass. This opens a feature called Spotlight, which you can use to search the contents of your computer if you're having trouble finding something. Just type what you're looking for, for example, a file or an app, and you'll get a list of search results. The last icon on the menu bar opens the Notification Center, which has been included in each version of OS X since Mountain Lion. Here, you can keep track of the alerts you receive for different applications, including events on your calendar, reminders, and more. The Notification Center can be customized to show as few or as many alerts as you want. The desktop itself is one more place where you can store files, folders, and even shortcuts for easy access. This time, however, to open an item, you'll need to double-click your mouse. Some apps have a full-screen mode that you can activate by clicking the double arrow in the upper right corner. This causes the window to expand, so you can focus on the application without any other distractions. To return to Normal View, press Ctrl, Cmd, F on your keyboard. Not all apps support this feature, but it's available in several of the apps that come pre-installed on your computer. The last thing I'd like to talk about is using your mouse in OS X, specifically a feature called Natural Scrolling. You can learn more about how it works by going to System Preferences, then choosing Mouse or Trackpad depending on what you have. In this case, we'll choose Mouse. As you can see from the demo, Natural Scrolling is basically the reverse of traditional scrolling. It's almost like you're pushing the content up and down on the page. This may seem awkward at first, but it's actually how many touch-screen devices work. Natural Scrolling is the default setting, but you can always disable it by checking the box here. I recommend trying it both ways to see which one you prefer. While you're in this window, you can also take a look at multi-touch gestures. For example, here's one that lets you go back and forth between pages using a simple swipe. OS X supports many different types of gestures, including pinches, taps, and double taps, depending on what your mouse or trackpad is capable of. Each gesture performs a specific task. To learn more, I recommend visiting this resource again once you become more familiar with OS X. That covers the basics. Now that you know your way around, you can start using OS X and taking advantage of everything it has to offer. You",False,,

For example, you'll have access to email, news, shopping, TV shows, and much more. And once you have a working internet connection, you can create a wireless home network, which will let your whole family connect their computers, smartphones, and other internet-ready devices. Let's look at a few different types of internet connections that you can have. Dial up connects to your phone line. It's usually much slower than other types of internet connections, but in some areas it may be the only option available. Generally, DSL and cable are better options. DSL plugs into your phone line, and cable uses your cable TV connection. These are both known as broadband internet connections, because they offer much faster speeds than dial up. This makes it easier to watch videos, play games, or browse the web. Fiber is the fastest type of broadband currently available. Using fiber optic cables, it can provide speeds that exceed even DSL or cable. However, it may not be available where you live, and it tends to be more expensive. Cellular is sold under a few different names, including 4G, LTE, and 5G. There are types of wireless internet connections often used by smartphones, but you can also get these types of connections for your home. Depending on where you live, a cellular connection may be a good broadband alternative. No matter what kind of internet service you choose, you'll need to purchase it from an internet service provider, or ISP. Chances are you can buy internet service from your phone or cable company, or you may want to shop around for a better price. Your ISP will guide you through the entire process of connecting to the internet. They will usually need to send a technician to your home to turn on your connection. Your ISP may also give you a modem and set it up for you. But if you prefer, you can buy a modem from a computer store and use the included instructions to set it up yourself. These instructions will vary, but the basic idea is that you'll connect the modem to your phone jack or cable TV connection, and then connect your computer to the modem, using an ethernet cable. Once you have everything set up, you can open your web browser and begin using the internet. If you want to connect several devices to the internet, you can create a wireless home network, also known as a Wi-Fi network. To do this, you'll need a wireless router, which takes the internet connection from your modem, and broadcasts it throughout your home. Your modem may already have a wireless router built in, so you may not need to buy one. To set up your wireless connection, follow the instructions included with your router. You'll need to choose a network name, also known as an SSID. Also, for security, you should turn on WPA2 or WPA3 encryption, depending on what your router supports. Then make sure you choose a strong password. After you've set up your wireless network, go into each device's Wi-Fi or network settings, select your network name, and type your password. If any of your devices are not wireless ready, you can simply plug them into your router with an ethernet cable, or you can purchase a wireless card. Setting up an internet connection and Wi-Fi network takes a little bit of work, but once you get it set up, your family will be able to use the internet without being limited to one computer.",False,,

Are you feeling overwhelmed? Don't worry. Take a deep breath. We're going to show you, step by step, how to set up a desktop computer. First, unpack everything from the box and remove any plastic covering or protective tape. Think about where you want your workspace to go and how you want to arrange the different components before you start plugging things in. Next, let's connect the monitor. If you have an all-in-one computer where everything is built in, for example, an iMac, you can skip this step. Otherwise, locate your monitor cable. Newer monitors often use HDM on or USB-C connections. While older monitors may use VGA, DVI, or another type of connection, it just depends. Now find the monitor port on the back of your computer case and plug the cable in. Most cables are designed to fit a certain way, so if it's not working, don't force it. When you're done, connect the other end to your monitor. Now it's time to plug in your keyboard and mouse. If they're wired, they most likely have a USB connector, so you can use any of the ports you see here. You could also plug your mouse into the USB port on your keyboard if it has one. If you have a wireless mouse or keyboard, it's going to work a little differently. Some wireless devices connect using technology that's built into your computer, while others need an adapter. You'll also need to pair the device with your computer before you can use it. You may want to read the instructions that came with your wireless device to learn more about pairing. At this point, you can plug in your speakers or headphones. If it uses a typical audio plug, look for the green audio port on the front or back of your computer case. However, some speakers, headphones, and microphones use USB connectors. Finally, it's time to connect the power supply cables and plug the computer in. You should have two cables. One goes with your monitor and the other plugs into the back of your computer case. Now plug both cables into a power outlet. We recommend using a surge protector to keep your equipment safe in the event of a power surge. When you're ready, plug the surge protector into a regular outlet. If it has a power switch, you may need to switch it on. That's all there is to it. Now take a minute to make sure you're happy with your workspace. Then turn your computer on.",False,,

Not just because it looks nice, but because things like dust and dirt can affect your computer's performance. But there's a right way and a wrong way to do it. We're going to show you the right way to clean your computer. First, turn off or unplug any item before you clean it, just to be safe. To clean your keyboard, turn it upside down and gently shake to remove any dirt crumbs or other debris. You can also use a can of compressed air to really get between the keys. To clean the surface, use a cotton cloth or Q-tip that's been moistened with rubbing alcohol. Never pour alcohol or any other liquid directly onto your keyboard. If you spill something by accident, don't panic. Turn off or unplug the keyboard, then leave it upside down to drain. If you're dealing with a laptop spill, shut down completely and follow the same steps. Modern mice don't require much cleaning because they don't have a lot of moving parts. Just keep an eye on the sensor underneath. If anything gets stuck here, even a tiny piece of dust, it can keep your mouse from working smoothly. When cleaning your screen, avoid household cleaners like Windex and disinfectant wipes. But also, never spray the screen directly. It can leak inside and damage the components. The safest method is to shut down or unplug your computer, then wipe the screen with a cotton or microfiber cloth. For heavier cleaning, moisten the cloth with water. For outer surfaces like the case and monitor housing, it's okay to use glass cleaner. You can also make your own cleaning solution by mixing equal parts vinegar and water. Just remember not to spray your equipment directly. Spray a cloth or paper towel first, then gently wipe. Don't forget to check the back of your case, which can get pretty dusty. If you see any build up in the ventilation fans, use a can of compressed air to clean them out. Finally, pay attention to airflow around your computer. That means no books, no clutter, nothing that might block the ventilation fans, which are designed to keep your computer from overheating. If you have a fanless computer, it's best to have airflow around the entire unit. A clean computer is a happy computer. Remember to clean your computer regularly and it's sure to stay healthy for years to come.",False,,

And with that, I'll now pass it off to Sarah. Take it away, Sarah. Thank you so much, Anna, for the introduction. A big warm welcome to everybody who's tuning in today. My name is Sarah Lou. I'm the founder and the managing director of the Dream Collective, and I'm so excited to be going through the session with you today around setting and reaching your career goals. I think coming into the New Year's, a lot of people are always thinking about how we can actually have great New Year resolutions, how we can actually think about new goals and new aspirations. And beginning of the year is a great time to do that, but there are some certain tips and tricks that's really important to bear in mind, which I'm excited to be sharing and discussing that with you. And hopefully with that in mind, it will help you to set and reach your career goals even more effectively. Given that we'll actually be spending quite a bit of time together today, I wanted to share a little bit more about me, who I am, why I'm here today, and just a little bit of background and context to help you get to know me. So as I mentioned before, I'm the founder and the managing director of the Dream Collective. For those of you who might not be aware of the Dream Collective, where a global diversity, equity, and inclusion consultancy. What that actually means is that we work with companies and particularly technology companies such as Google to help them attract, retain, and advance diverse talent with a specific focus around female talent. And for me, I actually come from a marketing and branding background. I was actually made a regional bread manager of one of the world's largest cosmetics before I turned 25 and I had a really successful corporate career. But as I was actually progressing through the corporate rank, I was confronted by the lack of female leadership and the lack of support in the corporate world to help and to really empower and enable female talent to go further. And that's when I took the problem upon myself. I saw the problem, wanted to provide a solution and started the Dream Collective. And over the years, we've actually directly worked with over 17,000 emerging talent across the world, particularly around the APEC region. And our programs have actually reached over 4.7 million since 2016. And I share all of that, not to say, oh my god, look at what we've achieved. But more that this is actually something really close to our heart in enabling and empowering individual to achieve career success. That's something that is the fundamental mission of our organization and something really close to my heart. And that's exactly why I'm so excited to be here today and to share some tips around setting and reaching your career goals. As I mentioned before as well, the Dream Collector is all about creating and building best practice diversity equity inclusion for businesses. And I really want to actually highlight the fact that in the corporate world today, this is exactly what we need. We need diverse talent to come into the organization. We need company to step up to provide inclusive culture. And that's when with that environment, we can actually thrive. So I think today's, with today's session, I want us to have a think about on an individual level how we can set and achieve our career goals and aspirations, but also in turn how we can as individuals bring diversity, equity and inclusion in the environment that we find ourselves in. Because that is our mission at the Dream Collective. With our operations across Australia, Japan, Singapore, China, India, and we've actually been ranked the top 10 diversity equity inclusion agency in APAC. And so it's really, really, really important for us that we actually make impact across the world. And so super excited to welcome every single one of you into the session today. It doesn't matter where you're dialing from, chances are we've probably been there and we probably don't work in that space. From 2016, we've actually done work and collaborated with different brands and supported organizations across 18 locations in the world. So Chesa Zah, we've probably met somewhere or crossed part somewhere in the world and really excited to be bringing this global perspective into our session today with you all. With all that being said about the Dream Collective and myself, I want to give you a bit of it inside into who we are as an organization and also myself, what we really believe in. Our company tagline is actually that nothing is impossible. The word in itself actually says, I am possible. And I want to start with this notion to reframe and rethink what is impossible versus what is possible. Because when it comes to setting and reaching career goals, very often what I see and what I hear from people is that that's too unattainable or that goal is impossible for me. And I think when we hear that we really need to challenge ourselves around do we feel it's impossible because we haven't done it before or it's actually impossible. In my own journey as well, every step alone, my entrepreneurial journey, people have told me that it's impossible. When I wanted to start the Dream Collective, people actually said Sarah, you've got no business partner, you've got no venture capital backing and you've never started a business before. What makes you think you can run a successful organization? It's impossible. And guess what? Six years on, we are now ranked global top 10 agency in the world and we've been growing consistently year on year. Very often impossible is an opinion is not a fact. So I want to start the session today really challenging you to think a little bit bigger, think a little bit harder and challenge yourself when it comes to goal setting. Set goals that feels a little bit unattainable because that's actually when you step out of your comfort zone and step into a potential zone of genius. We created this program specifically with that insight because we really believe whole heartedly absolutely anything is possible with a right mindset, the more importantly, the right tools. So I want to start with a mindset today, but throughout the session today, over the next 60 minutes or so, we will actually give you really practical tools to turn your career goals into action plan. So get ready to disrupt yourself. Don't let other people that have come across your path tell you what you cannot achieve. I think a lot of times receiving and seeking feedback is really good, but just know that is other people's experiences and very often is an opinion and not a fact. So if there's two things that I want to achieve with all of you by the end of the session today is one, understand why building an effective plan is absolutely the first crucial step to achieving your career goals. If you've got a career goals already, that's great, but I really want all of us to understand how do we take the next step to translate a goal into a plan and then how to effectively turn that plan into action with impact. So get ready to disrupt yourself, get ready to turn the impossible into possible and get ready to unpack career goals, career plans and career actions. So what stops people from reaching their career goals exactly? I think I'm probably not alone in thinking and knowing that most people set career goals. How many people have you heard around I want to achieve this by this point in time? I want to get this promotion or career progression at that certain point. But how many people actually achieve it and how many will actually fail? That's right. If you're ready to percent of people actually don't achieve their goals, not because a lack of plan but a lack of action. What will start the session really? Help you understand the relationship between career goals, career plans and career actions. Because everybody set goals, but a much smaller amount of people actually achieve them. And according to the research conducted by University of Scranton, 92% of individuals actually don't achieve the career goals that they set. And the reason is not because of a lack of plan but lack of action. So I want to really unpack the relationship between goals, plans and action. Understanding that people fail to take the necessary action because sometimes their plan seems too overwhelming and too unattainable. So this lesson will absolutely help you simplify your plans, help you remove distractions and help you stay focused on achieving your goals so that you can not only start but actually sustain your action over a long period of time. So what do you keep in mind when we start setting our career goals? Before we move into how to develop a really robust and effective career plan and how to take the right action, I want to make sure that we talk about the goal setting in and of itself. So people often say goals that can appear too large and too difficult to achieve. So the first pitfall is to ask yourself, are my goals too large and are my goals too difficult? I very often hear people talk about I want to achieve, I want to be promoted for example into a head of marketing role in a year's time when they are currently probably only at an entry level marketing role. So once again it's not to say that it's impossible but are they actually too large and too difficult and how can we break those goals down into smaller milestones? So that's really important for you to have a think about and I'll give you another example of how do we break goals down exactly. So that's how you set yourself a goal to say that as a salesperson I want to set myself a critical of achieving an annual sales target of that say $10 million. Instead of setting that one annual goal it's actually more effective to break that goal down into for example monthly goals. So breaking that down to monthly goals of that say you know, you know, $1 million per month or $3 million per quarter actually gives yourself an opportunity to evaluate and to reassess how you're tracking and give you an opportunity to celebrate small wins earlier on and throughout the journey to keep yourself motivated. A lot of times goals become too large and too difficult and that's when it becomes sometimes debilitating and people don't actually follow through with it. The second thing to ask yourself is is there a lack of knowledge on how to take the first step? So going back to the same example of that say I want to become a head of marketing in a year's time. Do you have knowledge of how to take the first step? Do you have knowledge or experiences or insight around what makes a great head of marketing? Or in order to occupy a role it promoted to a role of head of marketing what do you as an individual need to possess as skills and experiences? Are you setting that goal in isolation of understanding what it takes or do you have the right knowledge and do you have the right people mentors or coaches around you to support you on the journey? So getting started is usually the hardest. That's why the first step can be overwhelming and can actually be a big blocker. And what is a really important step to take is to actually look around you and see if there are people around you who have achieved the goal that you have set for yourself and to work with them to help educate yourself to unpack a little bit around what first step you can take to actually help yourself achieve that next career goal. So as yourself are my goals too large and too difficult? As yourself are there a lack of knowledge on how to take the first step? And the third thing is are you clear on why those goals are your goals? I'll say that again. Ask yourself are you clear why those goals are your goals? Having true clarity on your career goals is absolutely fundamental to achieving them. It's about understanding what they mean to you, why you want to achieve them and how they motivate you. And it's important to actually ask yourself that question because as you progress on your journey to try and break down barriers and achieve your goals there will be setbacks, there will be challenges. And one of the most important drivers and motivators to help you sustain consistent action over a long period of time is if you're really clear about the why. It's because if you are purpose driven and that's when you can actually last the distance and overcome barriers and hurdles that might stand in your way. We will continue to unpack and go through each one of them in a little bit more detail throughout the session today. But I just want to start by asking yourself these three questions when you've got a career goal ready. Compare them and ask yourself against these three questions and think about ways that you can practically simplify and break them down. Ask yourself how you can actually build knowledge on taking the first step and actually get super crystal clear on why your goals are your goals. Now setting a goal is only one half of an equation. We need to identify and anticipate barriers to achieving these goals. What I see a lot in people is that people come to us and go, hey Sarah, I've got these great career aspirations, great goals and I want to set them up to achieve in the next one or two years. And I usually go great, that's fantastic start, but have you anticipated a challenge? And I have to say that most of the time people actually haven't thought through or even haven't even occurred to them. What challenges might come in the way of achieving those goals? Setting the career goals is only one half of an equation, anticipating barriers to achieving those goals is actually the most important part. And an practical example I can give you is that's a you've got to plan to catch. I don't know how often that is the case, you know, in this post-COVID world, but that's the magic that you've got to plan to catch and you've got a destination you need to reach. If you can anticipate that, hey, given the time of which I'm traveling, there's probably going to be a lot of traffic and I know that there's flight reduction, so there's going to be a lot of people waiting and queuing at the airport. If you can anticipate the barriers that might face you, what will happen? You will probably leave home earlier, you'll probably prepare yourself to more time to travel. And when you do that, what happens? You will reach the airport on time, you'll reduce stressors and you can actually reach your destination. But if you fail to anticipate or prepare for these barriers, what will happen? You'll probably leave home, you know, without considering the buffer you to allow yourself, you'll be really stressed on the journey and there's a chance that you might not reach your destination because you missed your flight. Setting a goal as only one half of the equation, we need to identify and anticipate barriers to achieving those goals. And sometimes those barriers are cost and sacrifices. And these can be time with family, you know, it could be downtime to relax and, you know, such Netflix, it could be money and resources because you want to maybe invest in yourself to achieve those goals by putting yourself through further studies or taking up additional courses. So understanding the cost and sacrifices that would take to reach your career goals. You need to become aware of those cost and sacrifices and actually get really real with yourself on what are you willing to sacrifice exactly? Because at the Dream Collective, we work with a lot of female talent and a lot of times they come to us and go, hey, I want to achieve this career goal. But at the same time, you know, I want to be the, you know, mother of the year, you know, I want to be the father of the year. I want to have all these time in the world to spend with my family and whilst, you know, achieving this really ambitious and aggressive career goal in six months. And whilst again, this is not to say that it's impossible, but it's really critical to ask yourself, what will give? Because it's actually not possible to do everything all the time, every single time or at the same time. It's really important to understand and be realistic in knowing that if you want to actually achieve really aggressive goals, there will be cause and sacrifices that will come along the way. And I use myself as an example. A lot of times when, you know, I set myself very ambitious business goals and career goals. And I still remember that I actually had a conversation with my girlfriend who we used to catch on a monthly basis to actually let them know that, hey, because I'm actually going through a really intense period for the next six months, I'll actually no longer be able to attend the weekend gatherings and, you know, the long lunches because I'll actually need those time to reinvest back into my organization to help us actually achieve our stretch goals in revenue and in the growth of the next six months. That's identifying the cause and the sacrifice. And also consider that's something you're willing to sacrifice. If time with my family and my friends are not something that I'm willing to sacrifice, it's actually okay. But think about what are some of the compromises and the sacrifice you are willing to make in other areas of your life so that you can still allocate the amount of time required to achieve your goals. But without compromising and sacrificing things that you're not ready and not willing to do. So setting a goal is one half of the equation. I cannot repeat this enough that we need to identify and anticipate barriers to achieving those goals. Anticipate the challenges means that you can actually prepare for them accordingly. Identify the causes and sacrifices means that you wouldn't actually be facing those barriers later down the track and becomes really demotivated and conflicted if you don't want to make those causes and sacrifices. You can actually be realistic up front by considering what you're willing to sacrifice and not into what extent and therefore recalibrate the career goals that you want to achieve and the timelines within which you want to achieve them in a very realistic way. And what that means is that you've got a higher chance and higher likelihood in actually achieving those career goals. So we've just spent a bit of time looking at identifying and anticipating the possible challenges and barriers that might come your way. And now that's how to look at some really practical tips to help you remove these barriers. The first thing is to put measures in place. And sometimes this can feel like a really simple and easy thing to do, but I want to remind you that common sense doesn't always mean common practice. But it can be easy and small adjustment that you make to your daily routine that can make the biggest difference. So that's a, if you're the goal you've set yourself up is to actually invest more time to actually get ahead in your career. That might mean that you need to remove distractions through certain things that you come across day to day. It could be that your goal is to put yourself through an MBA program so you need to actually save more money so you can actually sustain your MBA studies. And that could mean, you know, unsubscribe yourself from emails from your favorite restaurants and, you know, fashion brands. It could be turn off notifications so we'll remove daily distractions from you. So whatever that might be, identify the barriers and put small but impactful measures in place so that you can actually set yourself up for success. The second thing is about creating an environment that actually supports you. Having accountability buddy, having a coach, a mentor or support is so important because what's the one of the most important thing and most useful thing when you go through barriers and challenges and setback is about having someone there to support you, champion you on and actually make sure that you last the distance. So once you've got a goal or a plan in place, feel free to share that with your family and friends. And like I mentioned before, around sharing my goals and my challenges with my girlfriends and letting them know that I wouldn't actually be able to catch up with them as often and as frequently as we used to be, that actually created an environment of support for me and a created environment of accountability. So put measures in place, create an environment that supports you and don't give them up completely right away. And this is an important one because a lot of times I see people obviously when they've just set up a career goal, they're very motivated to achieve it. So they said, you know what, I'm going to reduce my screen time from five hours a day to zero. I'm going to completely remove social media and like that's it. The reality is that you're making life so much harder for yourself when you give them up completely and right away. The magic is actually maybe reduce the screen time to half fast and then cut another 50% and three months, gradual consistent because that actually would actually make the process feels easier for you and it's more likely for you to sustain that over a long period of time. So how much about removing barriers to help you achieve your career goals? It's about making life easier for yourself. So turning off notifications, putting measures in place, blocking time off so you can dedicate those time to study or to pursue your career goals, they are specific things that you can do that would actually help you remove those barriers. But it's important to bear in mind that don't go from zero to 100 right away because that's not sustainable and that will make life harder for you. Make it easy, make it easy transition for you so that you can achieve that across a long and sustained period of time only then you will have longevity. And the last but not least is be real, be real about what you can give up and to what extent. If you need more time back in your day to help you achieve that next career goal, if you need to be putting in more hours at work and that means you can no longer maybe watch Netflix every single day, is that a sacrifice that you're willing to make and I want you to give that up and to what extent. Maybe you're not ready to cut your Netflix time from Wednesday out completely but maybe it's about watching it maybe once a week, maybe watching it once a fortnight. So be real about the sacrifices you're willing to make and it's important to know what you're not willing to sacrifice as well. So for example, if making the next career transition, if getting that career goal means taking time away from your precious family and friends that you're not willing to make, then it's probably important to recalibrate and reassess whether that goal is one that you actually want to achieve as well. Okay, so we've talked about what are some of the practical frameworks to setting up a realistic goal that you can actually attain it. And then we've talked about what's one of the most important thing which is actually understanding and anticipating the challenges that might come your way. We've also talked about really practical tools and tips on overcoming those things and how you can put measures in place to actually put yourself on the right pathway to achieving your goals. And now, how do we create this winning roadmap to reach our career goals? Plans on their own are not really constructive unless we know and are able to turn that into action. So the next part of this session is more around how do we take action? So now, got clarity around creating an effective goal and plan. The next part is all about taking actions. Firstly, a couple of actions that you need to actually be taking is simplify and breaking down your plan. I cannot emphasize enough how fewer is bigger and better. More is not more when it comes to setting and achieving your career goals. Don't try to multitask. So when you take actions the first action you need to do when you've got a plan in place is to think about how you can reduce it. And I have a rule of three which is three rounds of reduction. If you've started your goal career goal with 10, go through one rounds of cut, second rounds of cut and then the third round of cut. Leave yourself and also know more than three goals that you want to achieve and any given point in time. For our business, we actually set ourselves three goals to be accomplished in a five-year period. And there are ambitious goals, ambitious goals like region influence 30 million women in five years. And again, it sounds really big and untenable, but we then actually take that goal and we break it down into what do we need to accomplish by the end of 2021, 2022, 2023. And then we focus purely on the 12 month goal and then we simplify that further to in the six months what we need to do is A, B and C. So instead of having multiple goals and plans, right, and so taking the example used before, that's how you want to be promoted to a head of marketing in the 12 month, get a 30% pay increase and how complete my MBA. Instead of having all those goals cut them down, right, remember rule of three, right, and prioritize them in order of importance and pick the top one or pick the top three and focus on that first. Fuer is better, fewer, bigger, better. More is not more when it comes to career goals and setting career plans and don't try to multitask. Second thing is actually prioritize which I've mentioned already a little bit, but focus is absolutely key. Break them down into bite-sized mini steps. So for example, if your goal was to getting promoted in the next 12 months, actually break them down into a monthly milestone. So the first thing you might do is hey, in the next month, the action I'll be taking is to have a conversation with my manager to make my intentions known and understand what are some of the considerations or selection criteria for me to secure that role. Step one. Step two is once I've got clarity on what some of the skillset I'll need to acquire, create a plan on acquiring those top three skillsets. Rather than starting with a 12 month goal, actually prioritize and break them down and break them down to specific, almost to do list, right, on a monthly or sometimes weekly basis. Celebrate small wins like I alluded to before. Setting your career goal, achieving them and sustaining them momentum is a really challenging and difficult one. Therefore, it's all the more important that we celebrate small wins along the journey because as humans, we are wired to respond to positive reinforcement. So ask yourself, are you rewarding yourself every time you hit that mini checkpoint? Make sure that you celebrate the small wins and that's why breaking those action plan down is so important. If you've actually managed to have that conversation with your manager in month one, reward yourself a little bit. Celebrate a little. Celebrate small wins and those will become incremental building blocks to you actually achieving your goals. And then the fourth one when it comes to taking action is review your progress and adjust when needed. Note, here I did not say adjust if needed. I said adjust when needed. Change is the only constant. So be flexible about your plan and be willing and ready to adjust it when needed, not if and when needed. So for example, after two months of this career plan that's kicked off, you actually realize that you're progressing faster than you think or your manager has provided feedback to let you know that you're actually more ready than you think. Then it's actually about reducing that or maybe creating another stretch goal. Maybe you want to achieve that head of marketing role in six months or maybe it's about aiming higher and getting a more senior role in 12 to 18 months. Or it could be the other way around your company may announce that there's a new organizational restructure that the head of marketing role is no longer there. What happens then? You might want to re-examine what that means for you, have different conversations, reassess what that new structure looks like, where you can really win and utilize your skill set. So instead of being fixated or being promoted to this head of marketing role and anything else I don't want to hear about it, that's actually not realistic. That's a big and important part of taking action is knowing how and when to review your progress and adjust your action plan when needed. So fewer is better, break them down and prioritize, remember the rule of three, celebrating small wins and review your progress and adjust when, not if needed. This is something that I personally have found absolutely phenomenal in making and realizing my career goals. It's actually about making it visual. I cannot stress the importance of documenting commitment and progress your action visually. So map out a timeline and cross out milestones as you hit them and share it with others. So for me, because we've got this five year really ambitious goal and we've broken it down to a 12 month roadmap, we actually have quarterly milestones, traffic lights, ring, amber and red and we make it visual so that everybody in the business and particularly for myself that I know how we are tracking and at a glance, I would know what I need to accelerate and what I might need to watch out for and what I'm progressing really, really well. Make it visual. And a big part of it is actually about manifesting. A lot of times we know and we hear people say that you can't be what you can't see and that's so much truth in that. It's so much harder to achieve a goal or to stick to a plan when it's all conceptual. The challenge for us as humans is that we need to almost build that into muscle memory. We need to build our action into something that we just do automatically rather than trying to stick to a really conceptual plan that might actually shift and change. You actually have to commit and make that action plan visual. So once you've created that goal roadmap, breaking them down to small bite size milestones, make them visual, put it up somewhere in your room, in your office or for me because it's all digital right now. I actually visualized my, the three career goals that we have over the next five years into, I made it into a beautiful digital wallpaper and every time I open my laptop, that's the first thing and the last thing I see. Important to make it visual, document commitment and progress visually because the reality is that you can't be what you can't see. So visualizing where you want to be and what you want to achieve is very important, but visualizing the cause of not doing anything is equally important. Make it visible for you to remind you the cause of not following through with your action. For example, the cause of not doing anything might be that you stay in the same job you've hated for years. It might be that you don't actually get the kind of financial freedom that you might be looking for. It might be that you would not be able to lead a team that you will continue to be an individual contributor and not develop your leadership skills. What is the consequences of you not achieving that goal? Visualize that and ask yourself what is the cause of not doing anything? What is the cause for me for not following through with my plans, right? It could be a picture, it could be a quote, it could be a statement and make sure it's visible to you to remind you the cause of not following through your actions. This again is not to make it the doom and gloon and create a really pessimistic outlook, but it's actually about reminding yourself on the why, right? So it actually all works with each other. As we started the session, we've talked about it's really important to understand the why. It's not as a why it can be, you don't want to stay in the same job for the next 10 years. So making sure that you make it visual and that's both where you want to head and where you do not want to head. Have those either pictures, images or statements really clear in your head and out here documented is absolutely fundamental in enabling you to follow through on your actions. The other tips I want to share here is create a sense of urgency and brace that power of deadlines. So schedule in periodic meetings, maybe with someone to share your progress. If you look at the yearly plan that you have of achieving and getting that role of head of marketing, what are some of the monthly conversation that you can have with people? And how can you have like accountability buddies or friends or colleagues or managers or coaches who can actually keep you accountable and honest about how you're tracking and give you feedback. So embrace the power of deadlines, give yourself deadlines and a practical measure that you can put in place as putting meeting invites calendar reminders, right? And actually engaging with someone who can support you on this journey. So you don't have excuses to back out or get distracted by other things that come your way. Give yourself a touch, each single goals with a timeline is crucial and ensuring that you follow through with timely action. As we went through this session today, I've mentioned a number of times, the importance of having the right environment and the right people around you. So don't do it alone. Identify an accountability buddy who can support, encourage and challenge you. So who is an accountability buddy and what do they need to do exactly? The answer is actually not much. Rather than actually keeping your accountable, asking you questions and hearing from you how you're tracking around your goals and what challenges might have come your way when you take those actions. Identify accountability buddy and it's even better when that accountability buddy maybe have a career goals that they've set for themselves as well. So that rather than a one way check in conversation, it's actually, it can be both ways. So it can be a colleague that both of you want to get that next promotion in the next 12 months and you actually set yourself mini check in point every month. So the two of you can come together, support each other, check in and actually challenge each other to go, hey, that's not what you promised last month. And I feel like you're getting really distracted and you're not progressing as fast as you can. What can you do to pick up the pace a little bit? Identify an accountability buddy who can support, encourage and most importantly challenge you. Don't do it alone. And what's really exciting as well as celebrating small wins together. And I think this is a really interesting one because people sometimes feel that setting achieving a goal is just like a really hard and really labor intensive journey and it doesn't have to be right. And it could be that when you catch up with your accountability buddy, you guys go, hey, if we both achieve this goal by month two, we will actually open our bottom of champagne, go on little trip together, do it. We can away, celebrate small wins together. I know I've repeated that throughout quite a lot and because that's absolutely important, it's important that you make this journey of achieving your career goals a really joyful right. And sometimes it's much more fun when you don't do it alone and when you sell a very small wins with people who have been in that journey to support, encourage and challenge you. Now, remember the why. What's your why in achieving those goals? When it comes to setting and achieving your career goals, a common pitiful I see from people is that they set themselves in a goal that they feel is the right step to take. They feel that, you know, and my age or with a current career level, I'm on, you know, getting a promotion as that head of marketing role is just something that I need to be doing. That's not a valid why. A valid why usually comes after you've asked yourself six rounds of different why. Why do you want to become a head of marketing? I want to lead a team. Okay. As yourself again, why do you want to lead a team? Because I feel that would actually enable me to strengthen my leadership skills. Okay. Why do you want to strengthen your leadership skills? Why is that important to you? Ask yourself and get really deep and unpack the why is absolutely critical because it will achieve two things for you. One is that it would actually uncover what is the purpose behind your action. What is the purpose and what is the motivator for you? And the second thing I'll do for you is that it can actually help you achieve the right goal because a lot of times as you ask yourself and unpack those questions, you realize that you're actually working towards a wrong goal. What you want is actually any role that gives you an opportunity to manage a team. Your goal is actually not head of marketing. In fact, you probably couldn't care less about certain aspect that comes with the role. What's more important for you and they for what your role might be is about securing a role in the next 12 months that gives you that can help strengthen your leadership ability that can enable you to start leading a team because you want to influence. You see what I mean? By unpacking the why, it can actually help you get better, get clear and get more accurate around what exactly is the right goal. And as a result, the action you take will be much more aligned to you achieving those goals. And you wouldn't get to a point when you get to that head of marketing role and then you pause and ask yourself, actually, what did I do all that for? Because this is actually not feeling my cup. This is actually not what I want. Remember the why and a golden rule is ask yourself six rounds of why to really unpack to the core because that's when you uncover what your true motivators are. Remember the why also means creating a picture of success. This is slightly different to what we mentioned before around visualizing your goals and visualizing the roadmap. This is about creating a picture of ultimate success. That's a you've achieved your goal and you've secured that promotion as head of marketing and the end of that 12 month. What does that look like? What does that look like professionally? Personally. What does that look like in terms of your time? What does your day to day look like? What does that look like financially? Socially. Creating a picture of success reminds yourself constantly by making it visual. So that's why a lot of times as people progress through their career, they actually create a visual board, right? A visual career board that can actually visualize the different elements in terms of fitness. Where do I want to be in terms of career progression, financial reward and leadership capability? How big is the team I want to be leading? What is the kind of influence and what is the personal brand I want to be building in my organization? Understand your why and creating that picture of success, visualizing that as absolutely critical and fundamental to having the right goal, creating the right plan and actually following through with a right action throughout. We've actually covered a lot of grounds over the past hour already. We've talked about what are some of the things to consider as you start creating your crickles. We've talked about the importance of anticipating challenges and how to overcome them. We've actually talked about how to create a really robust plan, what a good plan looks like and how do you follow through with a right action. We've also talked about the environment, the people you need to have around you. We've talked about how to strip back the rule of three and how to actually make your plan prioritise it in a way that's fewer, bigger and better. All right, so this wraps up the presentation portion of today's workshop. Now I want to spend some time with all of you to answer a few of the top voted questions from the session today and some recent grow with Google workshops related to setting up crickles. Our first question is what are some exercises to think about to understand your fundamental motivations? I've always had trouble distinguishing those from my passing interest. Okay, so passing interest versus fundamental motivations. Two things you do think about, one is do they come back to you or is that at one off-thought? Do you have those career goals because your friend also achieved that in the past six months or is something that keeps on coming back to you no matter what? If it's something that comes back no matter what and is not a one off thought triggered by external factors, then chances are they are your fundamental motivations. Also a big reminder to revisit the six layers of why which we talked about ask yourself six rounds of why to get to the fundamental wise. So you'll be able to differentiate if it's passing interest or if they are fundamental motivators. Our next question is how do I set myself up for the career success after several years of career gap? Really great question. Some practical things to think about is number one transition time. Are you realistic about the return phase? Maybe if you're being at work completely, don't look to go back to maybe a full-time job, super intense, fast-paced environment right away. Nothing that you can't, but just saying that consider what is the transition time and the return phase is needed to set you up for success. Number two is invest in networking and also invest in taking some free courses and qualifications during your career gap. Or if you are planning on going back to the workflow workforce, make sure that you start preparing by investing in networks and actually invest time in building qualifications or taking online courses. Because what that does is that it will open doors for you, it will create access to different opportunities and it will help you keep your finger on the poles around how the industry is evolving so you're more ready when you come back from a career gap. Another question we've got here is what advice do you have for someone who is starting their career that you wish you had known when you were at this phase? Oh gosh, where do we start? The biggest learning I've had is probably say yes to all opportunities. Sometimes it can feel counterintuitive because we've also been taught to learn how to say no and create boundaries. And the key thing here is that they're not mutually exclusive. You can say yes to all opportunities that comes your way and you can actually experiment and figure out how to do it later. And my biggest lessons and learnings and growth throughout my career have all come from saying yes to opportunities that was a little bit uncertain but what it has meant is giving me the biggest learning curve and it's elevated me to the next level of my career. So say yes to all opportunities and be ready and willing to experiment. And last question we've got here is I reached a point in my career where it feels like I'm doing a lot but it's never enough. Do you have advice on how to navigate those feelings and burnouts? Okay, first thing I hear you and it's completely normal to feel that, to feel that. I want to normalize this feeling of burnout because a lot of people are feeling that. So the question I will have for you is ask yourself are you making progress and are you heading into the right direction? If yes, then keep on going by taking the right rest at the right time. Don't wait until it's too late. Take incremental rest when you need it and as it suits, don't wait until too late. If the answer to are you making progress and are you heading into the right direction is no, then my challenge would be to stop, recalibrate and maybe shift directions so you can set yourself up for success and instead of feeling burn out and continuing anyway, take a step back so you can go further. That wraps up about all the questions and the Q&A we've got. So thank you all for the questions that you've submitted.

You may have heard the term the Great Resignation a lot in the last few years. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented number of people have undergone career transitions. Let's look at some of the statistics. As of March of 2022, 44% of workers were looking for a new job. The quit rate in the US reached a 20-year high in November of 2021. Luckily, most people who have found new jobs are earning more money, have more opportunities for advancement, and have more flexibility to choose when they work. Some of today's activities will involve writing so you may want to have a pen and paper handy or a digital document like a Google Doc. You'll also begin making edits to your current resume, so be ready to take notes on a printed copy of your resume, or you can make edits in an electronic copy instead. Now, let's look at the topics that we're covering today. In today's session, we'll help you gain clarity about the career change you want to make. We'll start by exploring your why, including some activities to help you get specific about your desires for the next phase of your career. Next, we'll examine the strengths and experiences you bring to the table. We'll spend some time identifying transferable skills that you can bring to your next job. We'll take the information and use it to update your resume. After that, we'll examine what you've got so far and discuss ways to fill in any gaps in your skill set. Finally, we'll create a career change plan that will help you to take clear actionable steps towards your goals. No matter what your reasons are for changing up your career, if you're looking for a new job, you're not alone right now. When considering your career change, it's important to take some time to think about why you're looking to switch up your work life. Maybe you want more flexibility, or you've had a revelation about the type of work that feels meaningful to you. Or maybe you are frustrated with a very specific aspect of your current job. Answering the question of why you want to change your career can give you clarity on what kind of career you should pursue. It can also give you an indication of the types of work you should avoid. Even if you already have your next move in mind, knowing your why can help you focus your job search and prepare you for interviews. Think about your career goals. This chart shows four overlapping circles that represent elements many people find a career, when many people find a career rewarding. You should consider whether a potential career is something you love to do, is an area you've developed skills or expertise, is something that you get paid enough to do, and is something that the world needs. It may not be realistic or even desirable for you to find a career where all of these elements are perfectly balanced. For example, you may be at a point in your life where what I get paid for is the most important thing to you or your family. So your interest, strengths, or the world's needs may not be as important. Only you can determine the right balance between these goals, or if these are even the right motivators for your own career path. The next activity will help you get a better understanding of why behind your career, by looking back at some of the meaningful experiences you've had at work. In a few moments, I'm going to give you some time to write down the best experiences of your career so far. These experiences can be the kinds of career highlights that would go on your resume, like getting a promotion or delivering a project on time and on budget. You might also have experiences that moved you, felt really grace or impacted other people, like a time you threw a colleagues retirement party or helped a coworker deliver a great presentation. Take two minutes to write a list of the best experiences from your career so far. Now take one minute to list experiences from your career. Now take one minute to list experiences from other parts of your life, such as volunteer work, hobbies, or other interests. For example, if you organize a fundraiser event for a charity or a human-toured young person. For the second part of this activity, you'll look toward your future career by writing down some experiences you want to have at your next job. For example, maybe you want your work to positively impact your community, or maybe you want an increase in compensation or the chance to be more creative at work. To help you identify experiences you want to have, ask yourself questions like, do you want to work with a specific group of people? Do you want to use a specific skill set? What kind of impact do you want your work to have? What do you want your work day to look like? I'll give you a few minutes to write about the experiences you want to have in your career. For the final step of this activity, look over both lists. The experiences you've had and the ones you'd like to have, ask yourself, what themes do you see? What do these experiences have in common? Maybe a common theme is helping people, or selling a product or service you believe in. Maybe it's collaborating with a great team or solving complex problems. For example, if my favorite experiences were helping retail customers find the right clothing for a big event, renting a wedding venue to a happy couple, and coaching direct reports to deliver a great presentation, the common theme would be helping people hit a big milestone in a confident, joyful way. This could lead me to a job as a career coach, a therapist, or even a project manager. Once you discover the common thread or threads of your best work experiences, write it down. You might need more time to discover what your favorite and desired experiences have in common. Feel free to come back and add to your notes later. Take a minute to look at the lists and then find themes and experiences shared by both. Did you discover anything that surprised you? If you'd like, take a moment to share what you learned in the chat box. Your newfound insights can help you choose your field or job, or get more specific about the type of work you want to do. This specificity can help you to hone in on the right opportunities as you search for and apply to jobs, and begin interviewing for them. If you've started your own business, they will help you to make informed decisions about how to run that business. Now you've got a better idea of the kind of work you want to pursue. It's time to get clear on what you bring to the table. Your education, career, and life experiences have given you a unique set of skills and experiences that you'll bring to any new job. In this activity, you'll look over your resume and make a list of transferable skills. Transferable skills are skills you've already acquired during your career that you can apply to future jobs. Knowing your transferable skills can help you market yourself as a candidate for a new job or work in a totally different field. For example, organizational skills like budgeting, technological skills like programming or IT management, and people skills like managing a team can be applied to many different jobs over the course of your career. Be sure to also include soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, adaptability, teamwork, problem solving, time management, critical thinking, organization, stress management, creativity, and persuasiveness. Take a few minutes to write down your transferable skills. If you need more time to complete this step, come back to it after the workshop. Now, take another minute to write down the skills you've acquired in other activities like volunteer work, hobbies, and other commitments. If you volunteer in a soup kitchen, you might add cooking and hospitality skills. If you play a sport on the weekends, you might add that you work well with a team. Take one minute to add skills from your hobbies and volunteer work. Take a few minutes to write down your transferable skills. Take a few minutes to write down your transferable skills. Take a few minutes to write down your transferable skills. Now that you have a list of your transferable skills, I'll give you a few minutes to add those skills to resume. If you have a printed copy of your resume, just make notes on it. If your resume is in digital format, make notes directly to it or add comments. If you already know what type of job you'll be applying for, be sure you prominently feature the skills relevant to that job. For example, if you're coming from a job as a general manager or a restaurant and you're applying to jobs in real estate, highlight your skills in customer service and the ability to juggle multiple projects. Take a few minutes to write down your transferable skills. Take a few minutes to write down your transferable skills. Take a few minutes to write down your transferable skills. Take a few minutes to write down your transferable skills. Take a few minutes to write down your transferable skills. Take a few minutes to write down your transferable skills. Imagine you're transitioning from a job managing a retail sales team to a new career as a digital marketer. While you may have to learn some new digital marketing skills, you can call out your transferable skills on a resume and an interview. For example, you can highlight your experience with sales, ability to manage a team, and experience juggling multiple projects in a fast-paced environment. Or if you've been working as a front desk receptionist and want to go into project management, you should highlight the fact that you're a strong communicator and very organized. Transferable skills make it possible to move from one field to another. It's important to identify these skills so that you can point them out to potential employers and make it clear that you're qualified for your next job. Do this workshop incorporate the edits you've made to your resume. Then, take a few moments to update your profile on a professional networking site like Link Den. Make sure you call out relevant transferable skills in your profile. Also check that your profile is filled out completely and that your photo is up to date and professional. In other words, it's a high-quality photo that presents you in your best light. You've already started making notes on how to add transferable skills to your resume. Your resume is one of the most important tools you have to let employers know what you have to offer. In this section, I'll show you a few key tips for updating your resume to help it to stand out from others. Here are four key things that you can do to strengthen your resume. One, choose a professional format. Two, highlight your skills and accomplishments. Three, use specific examples and measurable details. Four, tailor your resume to fit the specific job description. I'll explain each of these in a bit more detail. Higher managers generally only spend a few seconds glancing over a resume to decide which ones are worth a second look. So make sure your resume looks professional, organized, and easy to read. One easy way to make sure your resume looks professional is to choose a pre-designed resume template. You can find these on writing applications like Google Docs or Word. You can also purchase a resume template from a designer or design your own. Here are some key attributes to employ when creating your resume. First, set margins to one inch and include plenty of white space. White space is the space on the page that isn't filled with text or graphics. It gives the reader's eye a rest. Next, use simple readable language. Use clear headings and finally choose an appropriate font for the position. You want formal looking fonts like aerial or times-do Roman are suitable for most positions, but you might be able to use something a little bit more elaborate or different for design and other creative positions. The image on the right shows a professionally formatted resume with clear headings, a plain font, and white margins. Your resume is not supposed to be a comprehensive list of all the jobs you've ever had. Instead, it should showcase the skills and accomplishments that will make the employer want to contact you for an interview. But hiring managers need to see the skills and accomplishments that are most relevant to the job that you're applying for. And they'll likely also want to know the most recent work experience you have. So put the most recent work experience first. Don't be afraid to eliminate jobs from your resume that aren't relevant to the one that you're applying for. At the same time, if you've done other activities like part-time jobs or volunteer work that are closely related to the job you're applying for, or given you skills that would also help with that job, include them. If you need to account for a gap in your work history, volunteer work can also be a good way to show that you were active in developing your skills even if you weren't employed. If you're starting a new career and you haven't worked in that field before, examine all the job experience or life experience that you do have and make connections wherever possible. Let's move on to citing specific examples and measurable details. What specifically have you done and how has it impacted your co-workers, your team, or the company? The example on the right shows a section of a resume listing and employers an employee's experience from a previous job. The list managed team, trained new employees, ran meetings effectively, and sold more than sales target. How could they have made this section more specific? One way to show this is to cite specific examples from your previous experience. Describe specific projects you worked on, improvements you made, processes you developed, or goals you attained. Describe the quality of the work you've done in the past and show how it relates to what you could provide to the employer at the new job. The second way is to use measurable details whenever possible to quantify the work that you did. For example, you might say that you increased sales at your current job. But what does that actually mean? Did you increase sales from one widget to two widgets per month or from one widget to one million widgets? Show your impact in numbers wherever possible. This is also a great place to add any awards or recognition that you receive. These show how other people have viewed your accomplishments. Here's an improved version of this description. It includes specifics and measurable details. It includes managed a team of eight employees, trained 15 new employees in two years, ran weekly team meetings of 2010Ds, and exceeded sales target by 20% selling 20 widgets over the company cycle of 100. This description makes it clear exactly what this job applicant accomplished and how valuable they could be to a new company. Many businesses use screening or applicant tracking software to narrow the pile of possible candidates before a manager even looks at them. These computer programs scan the resumes for keywords that are in the job description. If those words don't appear often enough in the resume or if the skills you highlight don't match the job description, the program determines that the person is not a good candidate for the position. Even if the employer is not using applicant tracking software, people also tend to scan resumes for keywords. You'll be most successful when your resume matches the language of a job description. When you create a resume for a particular job, you should incorporate as many of the keywords into your past experience and work history as possible. When you describe your past experience using the same terms the employer used in the job description, you'll have a better chance of passing screening software if the company is using it. You'll stand out more to the hiring manager and you'll show that you paid close attention to the qualities they want in a candidate. Once you've figured out what you have to offer and how to communicate it on your resume, it's time to find the skills you need to acquire in order to become a great candidate for the job you want. After you know what skills or experience you still need to acquire, you can make a plan to get them. The first step towards identifying areas where you'll need to grow your own skills is finding out what skills employers are looking for. For example, many industries are transitioning from traditional advertising to digital marketing and will need to hire individuals who know how to promote their business online. Data analytic skills can also help you get exciting jobs in many fields including finance, marketing and business intelligence. To address a skill gap, make a plan to gain those skills by participating in more training or education, through institutions like college degree programs or continuing education programs. You can also find educational resources in your local community or online. An option for online education is Google Career Certificates, flexible online training courses that can help you to land a job in high growth fields like digital marketing and e-commerce, project management and IT support. The video on the next slide will give you a quick overview of everything Google Career Certificates has to offer. To whom may I make concern? I'm applying for the position of user experience designer. Information security analyst. I'm a project manager. Data analyst. I've always been interested in helping people solve problems. Order off. I am extremely organized. Thank you, mama. You're welcome, love you. I have an exceptional eye for detail. Although I haven't worked directly in this field. Been out of the job market for a while. I recently completed a Google Career Certificate. It's given me a solid foundation in important areas like help desk support and cybersecurity. Thanks to my Google Career Certificate, I have completed real projects in SQL and our programming. It helped me learn practical skills like managing budgets. Thanks to my Google Career Certificate. I'm confident I'd be a valuable addition to your team. Join thousands of graduates and put your skills to work with a Google Career Certificate. You can also give yourself real life experience in the field or job you want to pursue. One way to do this is to ask to volunteer or shout out to someone who's already working in a job or industry you want to enter. Or if you find a project at your current job that's outside of your area of expertise, you can volunteer to take it on. Perhaps your retail manager sent out an email asking for sales associates to perform some data analysis about the duration of time customers who make a purchase spend in the store compared to those who don't. This can allow you to explore your interests and data analytics. You can also spend time speaking to people. Ask your friends to introduce you to people working in the career or field you're interested in. More structured way to do this is called an informational interview. Informational interviews are not job interviews. They aren't conducted with the intent of being hired. There an informational interview is meeting for the purpose of learning about a job, field, or company. Unlike a traditional interview which is led by an employer, you'll request the interview and will be in charge of leading the conversation. Make sure that you're prepared for questions before your interview. You can ask questions about a typical day at work, the interviewies, career path and educational backgrounds, and the benefits and challenges of their chosen field. To find people you may want to ask for an informational interview, reach out to friends, friends, contacts, or on-professional networking sites or even individuals in a different department within your own company. You can send an email to request an informational interview. In your email, you should state your request in the subject line of your email. Keep it simple and clear, like informational interview requests. When you explain your reason for reaching out to them, perhaps a colleague recommended that you connect with them because of your shared career interests. Maybe they're an expert in their field and you'd like to ask them for career advice. Or they made a similar career change and you want to hear how they successfully made the transition. Whatever your reason, be concise and straightforward. Then ask the recipient if they might have any availability to speak or to meet with you. Ask for more than 20 to 30 minutes of their time. Set a friendly and professional tone. You can ask to meet in person virtually or to speak over the phone. Let them determine the day and time. Be flexible and open. Remember, you're asking them to take time out of their busy schedule to meet with you. Finish your request by thanking them for their time and consideration. And even though this is not a job interview, it is still a good idea to either include your resume or link to your LinkedIn profile. If the recipient does not know you, your resume or LinkedIn profile will give them an idea of who you are, your background experience and your professional interests. We've spent this workshop getting clear on the why behind your job search. You've identified the skills you have to offer and your workplace and started exploring ways to gain the skills and experiences you need to get the job of your dreams. Now, you're ready to make a plan. You're going to start your career plan by taking the long view. What are your ultimate career goals? Pick your top long-term career goal. Here are a few examples to get you thinking. Grow my own consulting business, become a commercial real estate agent, become a UX designer, manage a team of sales professionals. I'll give you a few moments to write down your career goal. If you'd like, share it in the chat. In the next activity, you will break your larger goals into smaller, more manageable steps called Smart Goals. Smart is an acronym that stands for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time bound. If your goal is starting to sell real estate, your smart goal could be getting a real estate license by March. The goal of getting a real estate license is specific. Exactly what you need to do to meet that goal. If you're not successful in your career plan, you will know if you earn your license or not. It's attainable. It's in your power to research and sign up for the license exam. It's relevant. It will help you to meet your goal of becoming a real estate agent. And it's time bound. You will earn your real estate license by March. Of course, the step of getting your real estate license can also be broken down into further smart goals. But for now, just pick a major goal. Break it into smart goals. Then return to your career plan to create smaller and smaller smart goals. Now brainstorm three to five smart goals you'll need to hit to achieve your major career goal. Think of these goals like steps. What steps do you need to take to attain your career goal? Take three minutes to write down three to five smart goals that will help you to achieve your major career goal. As you brainstorm your smart goals, think about key people that you can reach out to you might be able to help you in your career path. Contacting that person can be a smart goal, which skills and experiences you need to pursue your career and how you might obtain those skills and experiences. If you run out of time, return later to finish this process. Choosing your smart goals is an important step for creating your career path, so make sure you complete this process. Your first set of smart goals is just a first step toward a completed career plan. Spend some time after this workshop adding more and more smart goals to your plan. Eventually your plan should consist of many, many small steps you can take toward accomplishing your major goals. Once you set deadlines for each smart goal, you can add those deadlines to your calendar, planner, or a reminder app so that you'll stay on track with launching your new career. The small steps you take every day will help you to create a filling new career path. If you're looking to join a new company during the next phase of your career, you may find yourself scheduling several job interviews. Google just created a free online tool that can help you prepare to make your best impression. The Interview Warm Up tool helps job seekers practice for upcoming interviews. When you visit the site, you'll be given the opportunity to answer commonly asked interview questions in real time. The tool uses machine learning to transcribe your responses that analyzes them for patterns, most used words, and job-related terminology. The Interview Warm Up gives you a low pressure opportunity to practice your interview answers before speaking with a real life recruiter or hiring manager. These are the tools at grow.google-certificates-interview-warmup. There are specifically designed practice interviews for the fields of data analytics, e-commerce, IT support, project management, and UX design. You just need to select a general interview to practice for another field. We hope this workshop helped you to better prepare to navigate a career change with confidence. Dreadcap you found your why by getting specific about the desires for your career. Next you got clear on your value by examining your transferable skills. You started applying those updates to your resume. After that, you discovered ways to fill in skill gaps so that you can pursue your new field or career with confidence. And finally, you completed a career change plan consisting of actionable steps toward achieving your career goals.

These partners shared some additional career planning tips for today's workshop. From WorkSource, Oregon, work with local labor exchange and workforce partners. They've spent years helping job seekers find new careers and skill up for new opportunities. They also have expansive networks to support you. From just for success, Miami, you're looking for a career change, compare your passions and your strengths with your experience and skills. They'll discover many transferable skills that transcend industry and job function, so focus on where you already have a leg up. From Johnson C Smith University, four career changes conduct informational interviews on potential jobs, companies that interest you. This wraps up the presentation portion of today's workshop. And I'll give us just a few moments to pass it off to SIXIA who will answer some of the questions that you submitted. Hi, everyone. I'm SIXIA and I'm excited to answer a few of the questions you've asked throughout the session. And as usual, we received quite a few of them. Now remember, if we don't get to your questions, we'll be back and answer all of them on the Grow with Google on our page below the virtual event shortly after all of this concludes. All right, everybody. So the first question comes from Andrea. Andrea says, what do I do if I have gaps in my resume and I want to change careers? Andrea, that's a great question. You can always organize your resume in a functional style. That means you would organize your experience by the relevancy of the skills as a relate to the job description requirements as opposed to the typical chronological order. So you can also fill in the gaps with any other training, a volunteer work is my favorite or projects that you may have during that time. Now remember, when they're hiring you for your skills, you don't necessarily have to have all of them. It's just important that you list all of your past positions that are connected to the job that you are applying for. Okay. All right. So our next question comes from Jamal who says, how do I void nerves when going into an interview? This is another really good question. You guys are doing really good. All right, Jamal. So first of all, preparation is key. So what I like to do is I like to grab a friend or a family member and ask them some common interview questions. So you can ask them to ask you. So then that way you'll be prepared for anything you might be asked. Let's try to avoid caffeine and get some exercise. So then that way you can calm the nerves before the action interview. You may also try some positive affirmations or some self-talk. So it'll really help you stay focused and to help you stay organized. So anyway, that's a really, really good question. Next, we have a question from Finn who says, is it true that applicants don't need to have 100% of the job qualifications listed on the job posting. Finn, another good one here. Most people applying for positions don't fulfill 100% of the requirements listed. If you feel like you're qualified for the position and fulfill most of the requirements, it's likely smart to still apply for the position you're interested in. So just make sure you highlight your strengths and the skills that you have and the things that they are looking for. All right, our next question comes from Rosalie. Rosalie says, how do you get over the imposter syndrome or other fears when considering a career change? Hey Rosalie, thank you so much for asking that. So for those of you not familiar with the imposter syndrome, this is a feeling that you aren't quite good enough to do what it is that you're trying to achieve. Now this could be a feeling that creeps up when you're switching careers into a field that you haven't worked in before. So I typically find that it helps to remind myself that everyone else is also experiencing this as well. And that you never have right now the opportunity to move forward, especially if you're really excited about this job. I also find that it helps to remind yourself that this is an opportunity for you to grow. And it's also an opportunity for you to practice your interview skills. So the thing that I always like to acknowledge and tell folks to do is informational interviews are also a great way for you to practice. And it's also a wonderful way to help you figure out whether or not a position is good for you. So anyway, that's also a very good question. Our next question comes from Matt who says, how frequently should I follow up applying for a job? So thank you so much Matt for asking that question. Most of the time when you apply for a job, you don't have a point of contact to reach out to. So you probably have to do a ton of research, but you're probably not going to find a contact name or an email or a phone number. You'll likely just be waiting for somebody to reach out to you in regards to the next steps. If you're already within the interview process and a recruiter or hiring manager has indicated when they would get back to you, that's a good sign. But only after the deadline has already passed, then you can go ahead and reach out to them. So those are my tips. I know that folks can get really excited, especially if they're thrilled about this potential opportunity for them to pick up the phone or send an email. It could be a little bit difficult for you to hold back. But the thing is, is that you probably won't find the contact information of the person of the hiring manager. Okay, everyone. So this next question comes from Ellis who says, does my resume only have to be one page? Okay, this is a good one. Okay. Thank you so much, Ellis, for asking that question. So typically, it says that applications or applicants can add one or more pages of the resume for every 10 years of work experience. But this can be different for everybody. Okay. Because we can't guarantee the hiring manager will go past the first page, we always recommend that the first page be highlighted and be as impactful as possible. So in keeping your resume to one page, it means that you should reduce the margins or sometimes the font, but check this out. Okay. It's also best for you if you do need to add an extra page, it's recommended that you do that instead of making the font smaller because you don't want the hiring manager to be working out trying to read the content that you have on your resume. Okay. So keep that in mind. Thank you so much, Ellis, for that question. All right. And so our last question comes from Warren. Hey, Warren. Warren says, I get overwhelmed when my goals seem unattainable or too big. How do I fix that? Okay, Warren. Thank you so much for asking that. This happens to so many of us and it's extremely normal. So guess what? You are not alone. It's really important for you to break large goals into smaller ones. This is really going to help you move forward. So if you take a look at what was covered in the presentation as it relates to smart goals, that'll be a good first step. So for instance, if your job is to want to accompany one day, which would be great, then that could feel a little bit overwhelming at first. But some of the things you could do to get over this is you can sign up for a free business class or just a business class in general within your local community or within your local community college. So that is a very actionable goal that feels much less overwhelming. So once you start taking those steps, you can build on each one of these goals until you reach your larger goals. Okay. So you really got some excellent questions here for this session. But this ends our Q&A session for today. Thank you so much for attending and thank you all for attending the full session of Navigate a Career Change with Confidence. Hopefully everyone learned something new. So here's another reminder. You can also find all of your follow-up resources on the same page you're watching in the resources tab below the video player. You can also access a recording of today's session by clicking the on-demand button if you go to g.co forward slash grow on air.

Nail your job search hosted by Grow with Google. Grow with Google helps people grow their skills, careers, and businesses by offering free digital skills, trainings, and tools. I'll start by introducing myself. I'm Basim, one of the instructors here with Grow with Google. And I'm so excited that you are here with us today. So today I'll show you how you can use Google tools to make your job search easier and more efficient. You may be looking for a new job to start as soon as possible, or you're looking for a more lucrative job opportunity or possibly exploring a new career. Perhaps you'll like your current field, but want to see if there's more flexibility like working from home or a new location. Maybe you'll recently be tired from the military and are looking for a way to apply your skills in a civilian job. The tools and application will show you today will help you to find, track, and compare opportunities in any of these situations and lots more. In this workshop, I'm working with my co-instructor, Anna. Later, I'll pass it off to her to answer some of your questions live at the end of today's session. We want this to be as helpful as possible. So please post your questions directly under the live-time video. We'll choose those top-booted questions to answer live. So please make sure to upload your favorites. If we don't get to answer all of your positive questions, our team will reply and answer you directly in the Q&A shortly after the virtual event concludes. If you'd like to access the visual resources for this class, check out that resources section below this field player on the right hand side. You'll also be able to access a replay of this virtual event in the future by clicking on demand on the growth Google on-air homepage. Also, don't forget the post and share on social using hashtag growwithgoogle. Finally, you also have the option to turn on YouTube's closed caption and to follow along. To do so, click the closed caption button directly on the video player on your screen. All right, let's get started. So in this workshop, I'll demonstrate how to manage the main task of a job search. First, we'll create a job search tracker in Google Sheets. You can use this spreadsheet to keep track of the jobs you find interesting or that you want to apply for. The sheet will allow you to organize any information you find on jobs, and then you can return to it when you're ready to prepare and submit applications. So using Sheets help you remember the jobs you're interested in. And also allows you to compare them and decide really which one is best for you. You can also use Sheets to manage the application process to really help you keep track of which jobs you apply to, which version of your resume you sent, and the contact information on anyone that you will encounter with a particular company. So once you've built your Sheets tracker to compare your job opportunities, I will share you how to use jobs on Google Search to find jobs that are relevant to you. I'll share you how to search and filter for jobs that match your interests and experience, and also how to save jobs you like and how to get alerts when new jobs are posted. So that's the bulk of what we'll do on the workshop. But we'll also briefly discuss how to create a resume using a simple template in Google Docs. I'll explain some resume best practices today, but if you're interested in more tips on building and policy and resume, definitely check out other resume workshops that we offer on Growth Google and AIR. Finally, we will leave you with a few tips for interviewing, especially as more jobs are transitioning to online interviews using video conference platforms like Google Meet. I'll walk you through some of the strategies to help you ace your virtual interviews. So the skills you'll learn in this workshop will help you during the job search and help you once you're even settled into your new role. Many jobs today require familiarity with technology, things like word processing and spreadsheets. So digital skills are more important than ever. As I talk about the features of Google Workspace Applications, feel free to experiment on your own device or you can simply follow along with my demonstrations today. All right, let's get started. So when you begin looking for a job, you might start by visiting a company's webpage or reading a job description. That can be a great way to get ideas about possible creations. But once you start collecting information about potential opportunities, it can be very hard to keep all of your options straight. Lots of people find it easier to search for jobs and apply for them in separate waves. You might do a lot of searching online for jobs one day and then while planning to apply for those jobs on a different day. You might find out that jobs are from a different source that aren't always on the internet. Like for example, friends and family may point you towards shop opportunities or you may find job postings at a community gathering site. So like with all this information coming in at different places, it can be easy to forget about the opportunities or lose a sense of urgency about which of them were in initial search. And plus job openings are posted and removed all the time. So it can be difficult to keep up with them. So to help you find opportunities and keep them organized, I'm going to show you how to build a basic tracker and Google Sheets. This tracker will help you manage a job search process from start to finish. So to create your job search tracker, you'll first need to sign into your Google account. So open a new tab, a browser window. Do not do this in the browser, and right now. So open a new browser window and then go to Google back home. If you are not signed in, you would then click sign in into your username and password. Most of us already be signed in. But so signing into your Google account allows us to access a lot of the Google apps that you can use to work from work or even from home. If you don't already have a Google account, you can simply create one on the Google sign-in page for you from the truck, right? So I'll give you a second to sign in or even to sign up. You can see here in this particular image, on the right, it actually shows you is assigning in to a Google account by clicking sign in and then entering in their email address. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. All right. So, after you sign in to your Google account, use the Google Apps menu to move between the applications. So, you're going to click on the Apps icon. That's the one right next to your first initial in the upper right-hand corner. These are all the Google applications that come with the application. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. So, I'll give you a second to sign in. These are all the Google applications that come with your account. Your most recently used apps are shown first. So, click more if you need to with the expanded list. And you can get to see your Gmail, Doc, Sheetslides, and many other applications here. You can also access your Google Drive where all of your projects are stored. So, actually, let's take a look at Google Drive first. And the image here shows the Google Home page. Google Drive is called out in the Google Apps menu here. So, Google Drive allows you to, for those of you who don't know, Google Drive allows you to store and access and share files like documents, slideshow, its forms, photos, all in one place, right? Instead of storing them on one computer, your Google Drive's are actually files are actually stored in the cloud, right? And so, the cloud save place on the internet where you can save important information. So, when you save something on your Google Drive, you can easily access it from any computer, smartphone, tablet that has internet access. File stored on your Drive won't be lost, right? Even if your computer you're on accessing the Drive crashes and basically the projects, everything you create on Google Drive are all stored and saved automatically on Google Drive. One of the cool things is you don't ever have to click Save. Good luck finding the Save button on Google Drive. All right, so, this is what your Google Drive looks like. And if you're sure you access it, if you've never created anything with Google Apps before, this may be empty, right, for you. If you've actually created projects and Google applications, they'll all be stored here in your Google Drive. So, now, if you wanted to, you can create new projects from your Google Drive too, it's very easy. So, to create the tracker, the new tracker that we're actually looking to create for our job certs, you can do that very easily. So, in the upper left-hand corner, you want to click that plus sign new, right? So, click that and then select Google Sheets. And then from there, you want to actually, however you're actually not going to click on Google Sheets. This is actually one of the things that people do. So, you can see, so, hover over Google Sheets and then click on Blank Spreadsheet. And then, so, the image here shows a user that is creating a spreadsheet using the stops steps that I just went through. All right, so, next you need to do is give your sheet a name. Right now, it's an untitled spreadsheet in the upper left-hand corner of the sheet that you just opened. And you give it any name you want, like my job certs. This becomes the actual file name and makes it easy for you to find that file later on in your Google Drive. So, it's important to say, like, as soon as you open up a new sheet, it is automatically saved in your Google Drive. You don't have to do anything extra to save your projects. And every make changes, so changes are saved automatically as you make them. All right, so, this image here, shows a Google spreadsheet with a couple of call outs here for some of the things for some of us who are not familiar with spreadsheets. So, it's spreadsheet and it contains many rectangles and user quotes out. So, you can see that on the top here, cells, it was individual rectangles. And cells are organized in rows, which have numbers. So, if you look on the left-hand side, number one is your very first row, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Now, you go across. And then, they're also made up of columns. So, the columns are the letters on the top here, so I can see A, B, C, D, and Fritter Quas. And every cell can be referenced by an intersection of their column and row. So, for example, here, I can see here the words, job position, is actually typed in cell A1, right? Because it's column A and row 1 dies the intersection and that is a location of job position. This makes it easier whenever you're referring to your own look here, look there, or even formulas. Those cell references are really important. We're not going to get too deep into that though. You can, of course, add text and inform adding and functions into cells, and we're going to discuss that in just a second. So, you can use Google Sheets to manage many aspects of your work or personal life. For example, you can use a spreadsheet like this one to create a budget, right? To calculate progress towards a goal or even plan a trip, right? So, to make your job search easier and clearer, let's customize this spreadsheet so that it tracks the important information about each potential job. All right, so first, you want to add some headings to keep track of the information you're finding your job search. Now, you can simply use your mouse to click on one of the cells. I suggest starting with cell A1, right? And then you can just start typing. If you want to, you can also use the arrow keys and the keyboard to navigate to different cells. And, of course, once you've put information in a particular cell, you can press Enter to go down to the cell below it or use a tab key to go to the cell. Next to it. So, just like looking at this, we can see in this example here, we have some different column headers, Job, Company, Salary, Website, and Notes in our example here. And now, these are great examples. And, of course, you can follow these, but understand that this is your spreadsheet, right? This is your job tracker. So, if you don't want to put in job, you want to put in something like job title. That's fine or a position. You can totally do that. Our company name. Maybe Salary is a thing for you, but also maybe you do things like hourly rates. So, you can customize this. And, anyway, you want to make this work for you. This is your tracker moving forward. If you don't want to use notes, you want to use a word to comment. Have added this is your tracker, right? These are just simply suggestions. For some headings, if you want to use less headings or even add additional headings, go ahead and customize this to suit your job search needs. There, remember, you can also do things like changing the formatting, if you like, by using, you know, if you want to highlight a particular cell and using the different things you can see in our example, that the letter B up in that menu, that's for bolding things. And, a little paint bucket icon. It's like it's kind of dripping paint there. That is our format painter. I'm not a format painter, but it is actually the fill cell color. So, you can actually use those to change the formatting to get certain things to stand out more for you if you want to. All right, so these are just a few of the things you can do with the spreadsheet tracker for your job search. Now, if you're interested in taking your spreadsheet to the next level, look out for our project management workshops where we dive into how to add color coding, drop down menus, and other formatting to keep your spreadsheets organized and useful. These are skills that are used on the job in a lot of workplaces. So, getting to practice them now may even help you prefer for a job that you're searching for. So, actually, proceed with your job search. You would add details to the spreadsheet to keep track of all information you need. So, we have everything set up and feel free. As you're moving through, if you need to expand, you can expand. So, for example, if you're expanding your search beyond your current area, you might add another column for location, right? Or you might add a new column called Work From Home. The track whether a job is remote or on site. You may even want to add additional column headings to help compare other information you're interested in like a job benefits or perks or the distance from your home. Customize these columns for what you are looking for in your job search. As you'll see in a moment, lots of Internet sites will list all of this information. And many will allow you to save job listings that appear on their site. But building your own curated database like this will allow you to capture the jobs that you are interested in, no matter where they're located. So, every application that you send is an investment of your time. So, being able to weigh the opportunities against each other is important. So, think about what you need at one time of your job and add those requirements to your spreadsheet. As you find job opportunities and add them to the sheet, you'll be able to more easily decide which opportunities are worth the plan for and which aren't really right for you. And what to apply and interview your sheet will be beneficial when choosing which job to accept. For example, you could find yourself weighing an offer between two companies. One that offers a higher salary but requires you to commute to an office every day. And the other one that allows you to work from home, most of the time, right? But maybe a lower salary. As spreadsheet like this can really help you to easily track the opportunities and the offers you have to make better decisions for you. So, finally, as spreadsheet like this can give you experience building and using project trackers, which are often used in project management. So, if you're looking at project management position, this is a great way to track a really important project for you. Okay. So, now that you've set up your spreadsheet with some of the things you're looking for, let's start searching for jobs, right? So, chances are you already use a digital tool to find new opportunities. Most employers list new jobs online and manage the entire application process digitally. So, to help you find your opportunities, we'll use jobs on Google Search. So, now jobs on Google Search pulls job listings from all over the internet, and creates one list of potential jobs. So, to get to Google's job on Search, you basically start with a regular Google Search. So, first things first, type Google in the address bar. Make sure you're not in the browser page that you're viewing this in. And then, in the search bar, type in a simple query like, jobs near me, or retail jobs near me, part-time jobs, customer service jobs, like whatever may be. And actually, you can see here, in this particular image, the image shows that Google search home page that you was actually typing jobs near me in the search bar. And you want to use similar terms like this. And of course, you know, add search terms that work for you and the job you're searching for. If you're not really sure what kind of job you're looking for, or you know, add search feels of things that interest you, or feels that you have experience in. So, if you're looking for jobs in a different city, include that city in your search. For example, you can do like jobs in Columbus, or manufacturing jobs in Atlanta. And then you press enter and you check out those results. So you might wonder how does Google know what jobs are near you without typing in a specific location. So Google apps like Google search use multiple signals to provide every person with the best results. Your browser may be asked, like as you type this type in jobs in me, to see your location, right, to help to complete a search that includes that near me. It will also show you where it thinks near me is, like near Washington, to see your Google misidentify your location. You actually do have the ability to correct it. And of course, you can turn off location sharing your browser settings, but many websites will still make guesses as to your location. You may have seen this functionality on shopping sites if you're searching for nearby restaurants, right, or businesses, and to find services like movie show times. You can see in this image the blue dot next to near San Francisco, California signifies that search is actually using the location. So jobs in search uses the same technology to help find job postings near your location. In fact, even if you don't specify near me, Google will still try to show you the most well-being jobs, which are the ones of course, we're close to see you. So a search for to simply saying retail jobs will probably be prioritized to those jobs that are near you, even without actually saying near me. That means that if you're looking for jobs in a new city, right, from somewhere else, you definitely should specify where you want Google to look. So within your basic Google search, where will appear a jobs window that shows a preview of several possible jobs. And you can see in this image it shows jobs on search with some jobs results, including the role, company location, and more details. And of course, you can click on these jobs directly if they interest you. Or you can explore more jobs, categories like management sales, retail, healthcare, customer service, and many others. If you don't see the jobs on search feature after performing the Google search, try a different search term, right. So Google's automated system tries to understand if you're looking for a job and then looks to see if Google has listening similar to what your actual query or your question is. And it happens all in an instant. So when Google finds search results that are similar to your query, the search engine will then show the jobs box. So for example, if you search for something like jobs that pay well. So jobs on search feature may not appear because Google doesn't have enough jobs that match the search you actually tried, right. All right. So to make searching for jobs easier, Google basically finds these listens all over the internet and collects them all into one window that job on search. So it collects as many important details about the position as possible, including as you can see ways to apply, sour information descriptions of work, reviews of the actual company. And you can read through this information to decide which jobs might be right for you. So you can see this image shows a job advertisement and you can see the blue lines that are actually calling out how to apply, right. Or even the job type or more information. Note that not every job will have all of these piece information jobs and searches pull information from third party sites. And those don't always contain the same amount of information. For example, job listings don't always include sound information and some listings and then others they may, right. But understand that whatever jobs it's pulling is what's going to be displayed based on what's in that listing. Whenever possible, though, Google links out additional information and websites to help you know how much jobs might pay and then how they've been rated and other information that might be helpful for you during your job search. Now let's talk about how to narrow down your search. Your search may return lots of jobs, right. To get more specific results, use a filter. This image shows the location of the filters at the top of the jobs on search results page. So turning filters on and off will show or hide different results, allowing you to see either smaller number of results that are more specific to your needs or just a border search results. You can use a top navigation bar to find many different types of filters, including here you can see here job title location, data job was posted, type of job or even the employer. So take a minute to experiment with the different filters, try turning them on and off and see what results come up. I'll give you a couple seconds to experiment with us. So now as you're using your filters, you'll notice that the filters build across categories. Unless you click the turn them off. For example, if you filter for location, the photo location remains on even when you add another filter for like employer. So the Spanish search and the same results, of course, you would take all of certain filters. So these filters are pretty straightforward, but let's go deeper into a few more filters that might be particularly relevant to you. So in the past couple of years, more employers have been open to remote work. So the filter work from home allows you to find remote opportunities that are relevant. So select this filter to see only jobs that allow you to work from home. In this image here, shows a job search results page. And you can see that icon labeled work from home is highlighted with a blue box. And so if you're looking to build experience in your career or haven't trained in a particular field, you can also filter by education and experience requirements. So this image here shows a job results page. The icon labeled no degree is highlighted with a blue box. To apply this filter, click requirements in the top navigation bar. This will offer options like no degree, no experience under three years experience or even more than three years experience. So no degree filter returns positions that do not mention college degrees in the requirements. Google is also working with job sites, including Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Ziffercuder, Snack a job career builder, and even US employers to make education and experience requirements clearer on job postings. You can also incorporate qualifications into a regular Google search by typing a query like no degree jobs or no degree jobs near me or no degree jobs needed. So there's lots of different ways to do that. Google understands that those queries and presentures with your results. And feel free to throw that in like Google jobs that don't require a degree. It will give you what you're looking for as well. Oh, finally, every year an estimated 250,000 men and women transition out of the United States military. If you serve in the US military and are looking for a civilian employment, you can easily search for jobs that match your skill sets using your military occupation specialty or even your force specialty or maybe enlisted classification code or rating. So occupational codes reflect your branch of service and your career path jobs and search will return open job postings from employers that are seeking the skills that you possess. Note that this search option is not available as a filter. Instead, you'll actually incorporate your MOSFS or any C code directly into your Google search. So in the search bar, you would simply type in a query about the kind of job you're looking for, including the words, veteran or veterans. And you might even want to use terms like veteran jobs near me, veteran, management jobs and whatever city you're in or IT jobs for veterans. So as you can see in this particular image of a Google search homepage, a huge of types in veteran jobs near me in the search bar. And you can see the other suggested searches like veteran jobs plus location, you know, a pair below that particular search. So once you've run a search query related to veteran jobs, you'll be prompted to enter in your MOS code on job search, like in this particular image, this search returns three possible jobs. So into your military service code on job search to find civilian jobs that require similar skills to the ones that you've used in that military role. All right, so let's imagine at this point you found the job that match you need, you read through the job description and you know your interest in this position. If you think you might want to apply for this position, but don't want to do it right now, click save. And if you can see here, the image of the save icon is at the top of your screen on the top right. So at the top of the actual job, listening, there is a tab called save. You click this tab to see all the jobs that you saved in the past. Now you can go in there. If you're going through, you see that maybe one of your jobs, and I interested anymore, you can simply click that save button again to remove it from this save list. Okay, so you've learned a lot about how to use Google the search for a new job, but the landscape of available jobs is always changing. It's important to check job listings frequently so you don't miss out on any new opportunities. Employers post new openings over time and not on any particular schedule, performing an intimate search every day and sorting through it to find new jobs can take a lot of your time. Time that can be spent writing your resume and preparing for interviews, right? So the save time when searching for job listings, you definitely want to set up email alerts. When you set an alert, you automatically receive an email about new listings that match your search criteria. So to receive emails about your jobs on search, on the lower left of your screen, you turn on alerts by clicking the new job alerts button. You can also adjust the frequency of alerts by clicking the alerts tab at the top of the page. You will want to go in basically and set whether you want the jobs to come, the alerts come instantly when that job is posted daily or weekly. And then like so, and even once you've gotten a new job, or you're just no longer interested in receiving alerts, you can toggle alerts on for this search to off to stop receiving emails. And you can actually see in this image here, the toggle is able to turn on email alerts for the search at the lower left corner of the screen. All right, so let's summarize how to make the most of searching for job on the search. So first things first, try lots of search terms and queries. You can use words and phrases or questions, experiment with different options to get different results to find what works for you. If you're looking for particular jobs that have special circumstances, add those to your search terms. Remember, terms like no degree to filter out for education requirements or veteran. If you want to filter by military occupation codes or specialty codes, don't forget to use things like near me or filter by a particular location, the final results that best match what you're looking for. All right, so then once job jobs and search, gather results for you, experiment with turning filters on and off to reduce or expand the job opportunities that are available. And then save job that enters you and that you want to come back to later. And don't forget to turn those email alerts to basically have search notify you when new job to appear. Remember those alerts correspond to the filters you've set up in that actual search. And then you can set the frequency for those notifications from daily, weekly, or instant. And this keeps you from having to spend time performing the same exact searches over and over again on a daily basis to see what new jobs are coming through. All right, so at this point in your job search, you'll hopefully have found several job opportunities. And the alerts you set up will keep you updated about more jobs as they become available. You'll probably apply for several jobs and it can be difficult to remember all the details about each application you submit. Remember that tracker that we said earlier, you can use that to keep track of all the possible opportunities and compare them against each other at a glance. You can also add more information to your sheets like if you decided to apply for a job. Notes about the employer that you find from an internet search. Details about job opportunities that are important to you. You talked about this before. Example like, you know, the real life of your work remotely. How far is it from your home? All right, so the sheet is also great for checking your applications to these jobs. You want to tailor your resume for each job you apply for, right? And basically keep track of those details or any correspondences you have with each employer. This can become a lot to manage and really would take over a lot of your time. Your spreadsheet is an easy place to organize all of that information. So as you find jobs that interest you into the details into your spreadsheet or use it as a hub for all of your applications and interview notes. And of course you can easily track the status of any job application by glancing at this sheet. And remember you can do this either on your laptop, your cell phone or whatever device has access to the internet. You can access this little sheet. All right, so now you fill under track with potential opportunities as you find them. After you spend time searching you can review the sheet to decide which opportunities to apply for. And as you proceed through the application process you can use the sheet to track every application. And looking here at this image it basically shows that Google Sheets titled my job search. It's probably with a whole bunch of jobs. It's probably with the information for the jobs, company salaries, web chat links, notes about individual jobs. And even they have an applied column along with an interview steps. All right, so let's continue with our job search process. So now that you've created a list of jobs interested in it's time to work on your resume. Now having your resume ready prepared will streamline your job application process. You could begin a resume by opening a blank document and listing your name and kind of information and professional experience. But to make that process much easier and faster let's actually start off with a template. Now for those you don't know templates are just a great starting point for really any project. They provide a lot of design elements formatting that you can use to keep fine sizes, styles and colors consistent throughout the document. Simply you replace all of these pre-design elements with your actual information. Google Docs offers a lot of free professional resume templates to get you started. So the layout, sponsor, college are different for each of the templates. But they also contain the same basic information that you'll need for your resume. Like your content information, your skills experience, education, as well as accomplishments or projects you've been completed. And then so you go through and after you've selected a template you can customize a document from there. So the access these templates you start from your Google Drive. If you see on the top of your tab that you originally were in with Google Drive, go back to that tab. If you close that out then simply open up a new tab, type in drive.google.com. And then here we are. And then so from here and you can actually see this image, this particular image, you can't see it but there's actually the new button. So the new button in the upper right hand corner and this image is showing you accessing the template gallery by clicking the new, which opens up the menu that you can see here. And then what you do is hover your mouse over Google Docs. You don't want to click on Google Docs. Move your mouse over to that arrow on the to the far right of Google Docs. And then from there you will get this second menu that shows up and then you want to choose from a template. Well, this will do, this will open up the Google Docs template gallery. And there we'll have several templates you can choose from, pick one of the templates. And this will automatically create a new document with all the placeholder text and formatting that you actually saw in that template. From there you would rename your document so it's easy to find later. And then a document course is automatically saved to Google Drive. So it's a quick tip. If you want to skip the template and start a new blank document quickly, you can simply type in doc.new and your web browser address bar. And this is an open-up brand new Google Doc. If you don't have resume yet or if you are thinking to refresh, feel free to try and be stepped below and work on the template. So now we're going to go through some steps to customize your template altogether. Once you choose a resume template, you'll want to use it and add in your name, contact information and even your professional history. And then you want to select that placeholder text and replace that with of course your particular text. So you type your information. So this animation actually shows a user entering in the text, replacing the name with their name in the summary field. They type in their summary season business analyst with six plus years experience, increasing profitability. So for actually guiding someone what's the including resume and how to make a strong impression. We're not going to go through too much on this, but definitely check out our other resume workshops on growth Google on air. For now let's discuss some basic ways to customize your resume. So templates come with pre-arranged formatting, but of course you can edit your template to fit your own particular style. You can change the font, choose one that looks more professional. So like in this particular example from the edit menu, these selects all of their text in the resume and then changes the font to aerial using the font dropdown. Adding formatting like bowling section headers and adding italics, you can also add hyperlinks to show potential employers more of your work. So linking to other places, adding elements like this will actually make your resume easy to read and unique to you. Even if you start from a template, make those customizations that help you stand up. So while you're searching for a new job, you probably apply for lots of opportunities. In this case, like I said before, you should create and submit distinct resumes for each job that you applied to. Especially if you're applying the jobs and different industries that require different skills and tasks. Even if you're applying for jobs in the same career field, right, improve your resume by including specific keywords from that job description in your skills or easy. This is a job tracker spreadsheet will come in handy by simply tracking each job opportunity and descriptions and telling your resume to each opportunity, you have a better chance of getting hired. So you want to think like an employer, right? So the employer, you know, are you more likely to hire a person whose resume looks generic to the industry or the person whose resume is tailored to the job description that you want to be. You carefully tailored before you posted it online. All right, so you can start from scratch and build a brand new resume for each possible job. That's a lot of work though, but that can be tedious and time consumers when I'm going to do that, especially if those resumes are whole similar, right. So to make your application process easier, simply make a copy of the existing resume and edit it instead of starting a new document every single time. From then, you want to make sure you rename it so that you can easily tell the difference between the different versions of your resume. For example, if you're a designer with web experience, you might have one resume that's titled web design resume. Another one that's, you know, different one for a broader work called graphics design resume. Or you may simply just name the version based on a company that you're actually applying to, right. So in this particular image shows a user making a copy of the resume and then they rename it to a deer or a pretel resume sales. So your job search process will be a lot more successful if you get feedback on your materials, right. So to get someone's input on something like your resume, you want to share that document with them. It's very easy. As you can see in the upper and in corner of our particular image, this you select that share icon. And then from there, you would enter in the email address for the person whose input you want. And then so once you put that person email address, it'll ask you what type of access they should have. So there's three different levels of access, edit, comment, and view. Edit, of course, gives them the ability to directly edit that document. If you don't want them to do that, but to be able to input some feedback in the document, you can give them comment on the access, which allows them to highlight particular parts of the document, add a comment, and then you can take that comment, and then include it, and you know, make those changes yourself. Or you can simply just give them view only access. They won't be able to comment or edit. They can simply see the document and of course provide that feedback to you in another medium, whether it's face-based phone call or whatever, right. So notice a box at the bottom that's labeled actually setting it up here to go into this. You'll see a box is labeled notified people. So when you share a document sheet or a presentation or anything with someone, they will receive an email about it. If you don't want to send an email, you would simply uncheck this box. But remember, if you uncheck this box, although if you share it to them to another Google account, they will appear in their drive, but they won't know it's there. So you'll have to find the way to tell them that you've actually shared that document. Next, you can add a note about the document and click send. So the next time that person checks her email, they will have an email from Google Docs that includes your note and a link to actually access that document. So you know, you can see our example here of a user sharing her resume. She selects the share icon. She adds her friend's email address. She selects can comment, because there's ones. And then she typed her brief note that means, hi, Alex, would you take a look at my resume and let me know how I can improve. And then she shares the document. You can also share your resume as a PDF or a portable document file. A PDF document format is used when you need to save files that should not be modified, but easily view or printed. The file will appear the same no matter what kind of computer or software the employer uses to open it. Many hiring agents will request your resume actually in PDF format. So it's good practice and learning how to actually create one. Some for no, most computers can read PDF files. So, you know, you'll most likely be able to practice creating and sending PDF by sending to anyone, right? You send it to a friend or a family member. Once you get it over to them, we know the document format is working. So if you want to create a PDF from an actual document, you would go to your file menu and then scroll down to download and then select PDF document. As you can see in this particular image here, I was going to show you the file menu, then download menu and then the PDF document as one of the options in that download menu. This will simply download the PDF of your resume to your computer. Once you have your resume downloaded as a PDF, you can attach it to an email and share it with a partner. So you would go to your Gmail account or another email application and add the email address to person that you were sharing your resume with. Type a brief message letting them know why you're sharing this with them and how you're actually sharing your resume. And then you can of course attach it using a paper click icon at the bottom of the email window where you will actually be able to attach it. And then if you're looking for it most likely when you download the resume, it went to your download folder. So check that downloads folder first to find the resume. And then of course you're going to proof each email, make sure you can see the resume attached and before sending it out. And so this example here shows a user sending an email with the PDF of his resume to a friend. The PDF is attached to the bottom of the email window and you can see that paper click icon has actually been called out with the little blue box. So actually if a job advertisement asks you to email your resume as a PDF document, you can follow these simple steps to be able to send that over to that hiring manager. Right, so you can actually organize different versions of your resume using the Google Drive. So we talked about this before. Remember you're going to different job applications. You want to customize those resumes to really tailor it to that particular job that you're applying for. But to keep track of an individual job search, you can simply add a link to each of those resumes in your job tracker sheet. Now you're thinking like what do you mean a link to my list of those merge rates? You may not have noticed, but anytime you create any document spreadsheet or presentation using Google tools, it's creating it in a web browser. So if you look at the actual website address at the top there, that is a direct link to that document. So you basically open up those different versions, right, when you create the version, send it out, go to that web browser and then copy and paste that link into the resume link field. You can see this image. So the image shows the resume links and column age of this particular job tracker. And then of course, when you have that information there, preparing for that interview the next week, two weeks or whatever it is, you have a direct link to the actual resume submitted. So you can actually refresh your memory on what the company already knows about you. And of course, you can use this information to kind of anticipate any potential questions and you know, so you can tell a consistent story about your career. So to add different resumes to your tracker, simply add that column if you want to and then paste those links into the appropriate cell. Speaking of interviews, more and more companies are hosting their interviews online using tools like Google Meet. So Google Meet is a video conferencing tool that allows you to connect with friends family and colleagues from any place with an internet connection. You can use Meet to host meetings at work. And then while you're looking for a new job, you will likely use Meet to attend an interview. Even if you even if your interview takes place in person, you can use Meet to practice beforehand. There are a lot of advantages to video conferencing for first interview or even for the whole interview process. Companies save money on your visit, right? And it can be easier for job seekers to fit interviews alongside their current work or even, you know, just organizing for their ongoing job search. But many job seekers find that video interviews to be can be intimidating, right? Maybe seeing yourself on a video feed makes you nervous or maybe the thought of background noises causing daddy about, you know, the microphone. So let's go over a few ways to ace and remote interview. Just as with any person in view, your skills will get better with practice. So to calm any potential nerves about video conferencing and to ensure that you look for a professional, take a look at these tips for interviewing with your friends. And just looking here at this particular image on this slide shows a group of people having a beta call on Google Meet, like you might see in a panel style interview. All right. So here are some best practices that will help you to prepare. When you're speaking with your interviewer, look forward at the camera. Depending on the size of your device, your interviewer space may appear at the bottom of your screen. So if you look directly at their face, it may appear as though you're not making eye contact. So to help your interviewers feel like you're getting to know you, right, keep your eyes focused on the camera. And it's actually a really great tip from one of my colleague, Stasia, when she just talks about beta conference again, general. She forgets all time. She's like, and I have a little sticker. She's a little sticker that points right to the rear camera and says, look here. All right. So if you need to use something that's dramatic, and you can look at that and then just kind of get inside, we keep focused on the actual camera. One way to ensure that your interviewers see you in the best light, pay attention to your lighting, right. So to look professional, you want to place a warm color lamp near the back of your computer screen, or even consider changing your desktop background to a light color. The actual light reflecting on your face will make it easier to see. And since a lot of your communication is non-burble, if your interviewer sees your face, they will be able to communicate with you more smoothly. So if your office, these days, might be kitchen, a living room, bedroom, basement, whatever it is, if you can find a neutral background to avoid distractions. If you can't find or make a good spot, use neutral computer generated backgrounds or blur background features to make your surrounding less obvious. Don't use crazy backgrounds, neutral, very important, calm, because you don't want the background to take away from you. To shine during a room interview, you still want to dress like you would for an in-person interview, even if you're staying in your living room, paying attention to how you present yourself will show your interviewers that you are really, really serious about this opportunity. Finally, interviewing is a skill set, right? And you'll get better with practice. So ask a colleague or a friend to hold practice interviews with you as often as you can. To learn more about setting up your own video calls with Google Meet, definitely check out our other virtual interviewing workshops. Alright, so we've covered a lot today. Google Tools can simplify your job search process from start to finish. Throughout today's workshop, we've examined several aspects of finding new opportunities, searching for them, preparing a resume, managing the whole process, and giving a strong interview. Alright, so let's just quickly review. We've created a job search tracker in Google Sheets. You can use this tracker to manage all of your corruptions, recording notes about each interview and tracking the status of your applications. Next, we use jobs and Google Asserts to find potential opportunities. We examine filters that you can narrow down your search. You can use these filters to find jobs, especially for veterans to locate remote opportunities, or even find growing companies. To prepare you for the application process, we examine Google Docs and the resume templates. We've previewed how to copy and share a file so that you can edit it for every unique application. And finally, we know what are some quick tips for giving a great interview in Google Meet. Alright, so let's talk about the next steps in your job search. We want to leave this workshop with a clear sense of what you should do next. So here are a few ways to move forward. First, create a job search tracker using Google Sheets. Use jobs in Google Asserts to find a job that's right for you. Don't forget to use those filters and narrow down your search. Save those favorites and then set up those email alerts so you don't have the waste time doing the search over and over again. Then, from there, develop the resume. Open up in Google Doc and review possible templates to get you started. Use Meet, or Meet with a friend or mentor over Google Meet to practice those interview skills, regardless of whether those interviews you're going to be doing will be face-to-face, or they'll be virtual interviews. And then, of course, continue growing your career in other ways. Consider our other professionalization workshops. These courses help you to work, teach, and learn from anywhere. Whether you're looking for a new job right now or planning for a new opportunity in the future, job searching can be intimidating, but it can also be a great opportunity to grow your professional skills.

This wraps up the presentation portion of today's workshop. Thank you so much for listening today. I'll give you a few moments of pass-off to Anna who will answer some of your questions that you've submitted. I'll see you next time. You can see the link in the description. Thanks, everyone. I'm Anna and I'm excited to answer a few of the questions you've asked throughout the session. As usual, we've received quite a few of them. Remember, we don't get to your question. We will go back and answer all of them on the Grow with Google on Air Page, below the virtual event, shortly after it concludes. My first question comes from Pete. Pete asked, how do I avoid nerves when going into an interview? Remember, this is something many people are challenged with when going into an interview. You're not alone. First of all, preparation is key. I recommend grabbing a friend or maybe a family member and have them ask you some common interview questions as if you were in that interview so that you feel really prepared going in for anything you might be asked. Also, try to avoid caffeine, get a good breakfast, maybe get some exercise to calm those nerves before the actual interview. When it comes to right before the interview, you can try some positive affirmations, which are just telling yourself statements over and over again that are really positive, also positive visualizations or just picturing yourself doing a really great job in that interview or maybe what are called power stances, so standing up really strong with your arms open, maybe in the lobby waiting for that interview. My next question comes from Rosario. Rosario asks, how can I get a job at Google? Great question, Rosario. You can totally follow the exact same process that Beseem just laid out and do a search for Google Jobs near me on Google Jobs. Or you can instead go directly to careers.google.com to see all of the positions available in your area. My next question comes from Lydia. Lydia asks, how frequently should I follow up after applying for a job? This is one of those questions that's really hard to know once you applied for something, you know, if people got your resume or when you're going to expect to hear from them. So most of the time when you've actually applied for a job, you won't have a point of contact to reach out to. You'll likely just be waiting for someone to reach out to you about next steps. Now, it's a little bit different if you are already within that interview process and maybe a recruiting or hiring manager has indicated when they would get back to you. Let's say they say, all right, you will hear something from me Tuesday afternoon. If that deadline passes and only after that deadline passes, let's say Wednesday afternoon, you still haven't heard anything. It's definitely appropriate to reach out for a status update and just say, hey, you know, I... You had mentioned that you were going to reach out to me on Tuesday afternoon. Just wanted to check and see what the status is on the job. All right, my next question comes from Jen. Jen asks, is it true that applicants don't need to be 100% on job qualifications listed on the job posting? Hey, Jen, it's true. A lot of people, when applying to positions, don't actually fulfill 100% of all of the requirements listed in that job description. There have actually been some studies done on men versus women and who actually applies to jobs when they hit 100% of the requirements, neither side actually typically hits 100% when they are applying. If you feel like you're qualified for that position and you fulfill most of those requirements, it's likely smart to still apply for that position that you're interested in. Some of those skills may hold less or more weight with the hiring manager. So if it's something that's not really important to them, but you have a lot of other things that they find interesting, you may very well still get that job. Okay, my next question comes from Charlie. Charlie asks, how do you get over your imposter syndrome when going over the job descriptions? If anyone isn't familiar with imposter syndrome, it's that feeling of, oh, I'm not going to be good enough for this job or I'm not going to get this job because I don't have the right skills. It's that kind of feeling of insecurity. This is a great question and I think it's really important to remind yourself that everyone experiences this at some point in their life and in their career. So you are definitely not alone. And also remind yourself that you'll never have an opportunity to get a job that you really want unless you actually apply for it. You have to go out there and take the chance to possibly get that great, great reward in the end. So just because you don't get one job doesn't mean that a similar or even better job won't come along that you get even if you're feeling like you're not fully qualified or good enough. You never know what's going on behind the scenes and hiring. You know, they may find someone internally or they may have a friend that they want to hire. So just because you don't get one position doesn't mean you absolutely shouldn't apply for another similar type of position. It just takes a lot of persistence. All right, so that concludes our Q&A for today. Thank you all for joining us for nail your job search. Hopefully you all learned something new.

To do so, click the closed captioning button directly on the video player on your screen. Now, let's get started. We're here today to talk about resumes. First, we will touch on ATS or applicant tracking systems, an important first hurdle for your resume before it even reaches recruiters. Then we'll try a quick glance resume evaluation activity. You'll look at some resumes quickly to get a sense of how formatting and errors might make a poor first impression on a hiring manager. After that, we'll dive into four strategies that make any resume better using professional formatting, highlighting your skills and accomplishments, citing specific examples and measurable details and tailoring your resume to the job description. For each strategy, we'll practice editing a resume and I'll share digital tips that can make resume writing easier. By the end of the session, you'll be ready to create your own resume or to apply these strategies to your existing resume. Your edits will help your resume stand out to hiring managers and get you closer to an interview. Let's move on to talk about strategies you can use to improve your resume. Let's take a minute to think about the purpose of a resume. How much time and average do you think an employer spends looking at a resume? Some people will say five minutes, ten minutes, or even as much as thirty minutes. We often assume that the employer will read our entire resume from top to bottom, but that is rarely the case. Are you surprised to learn that most recruiters and employers only spend about six to ten seconds looking at a resume? The goal of a resume is to showcase the skills and accomplishments you have and to make the employer want to call you in for an interview. You want to convince them that you're a good fit for the job you're applying for and they don't need to know everything you've ever done for you to accomplish that. Many companies use applicant tracking systems or ATS as the starting point when considering job candidates. ATS is a type of software that sorts through resumes and applications, selecting which ones to pass on to a human recruiter. ATS helps recruiters by streamlining the review process and allows them to quickly and easily track, review, and identify applicants. For candidates, this means that if you want a recruiter to ever see your resume, you need to make sure it gets through the ATS. These systems work by scanning resumes for certain keywords and years of experience in the field based on the job description and requirements. Unfortunately, ATS systems can't look at a resume and make a thoughtful or nuanced decision on an individual candidate the way a human can. So they may wind up eliminating certain resumes due to formatting or other issues that keep them from being able to read, keep them from being able to read the resume. There are a few tips to help you make sure that your resume makes it through an ATS and into the hands of a human recruiter. The image on the right is of a resume that meets the requirements I'm about to mention. Use the right file type. ATS systems are best able to read docs and PDF files. If you create a resume using Google Docs, you can download it as a DocX or as a PDF. Next, keep formatting simple. Since ATS scans resumes for keywords, it can be confused by fancy formatting, graphics, and even tables, multiple columns, and text boxes. If an ATS isn't able to read your resume, it will reject it. So keep your formatting relatively simple. Later in the workshop, I'll show you some Google Doc templates, which all work really well with ATS systems. Next, use keywords from the job description. ATS systems are shown the job listing in order to learn which words to seek out in resumes. So when the ATS detects those keywords in your resume, it will flag you as a qualified candidate. For this reason, you should adjust your resume to reflect the words used in the job listing. Next you want to avoid headers and footers. Many ATS systems can't read headers and footers well. So make sure you don't put any critical information like your contact info in a header or footer. Now that you understand how ATS works, you can make choices that will ensure your resume gets through applicant tracking systems and in front of a human recruiter. So the rest of this workshop will be focusing on how to impress that recruiter. Let's start with a challenge. Imagine for a moment that you're a hiring manager looking for someone to fill a position. You know what you're looking for, but you're busy, and there are a million things on your to-do list. So now you're trying to get through a large stack of resumes before lunch in 30 minutes. These resumes have already made it through the ATS. Now we'll do an activity to help you get a sense of how a resume is made of first impression. For this activity, make sure that you have a pen and paper nearby or a digital notes document that you can access easily. First we'll look at a sample job description. Then I'm going to show you six examples of resumes. You have about seven seconds only to look at each resume and process it. For each one you see it right down one word that describes the resume and then decide with a quick yes or no if you'd like to spend more time on it. Then we'll move on to the next resume. You can write down your word and your yes-no on a piece of paper in front of you or on a digital note. Here's the job description along with some of the skills that you might be looking for. We seek a high performer to join our sales team. The successful candidate will be responsible, motivated, sales associate with pro-proven experience. This person will manage the entire sales cycle, identifying sales needs, locating and expanding new markets, designing and delivering sales presentations and presiding over negotiations. To meet or exceed personal and departmental sales goals, you'll need excellent customer service skills and entrepreneurial worldview, business acumen and a professional sales philosophy. Keep this description in mind as we review these six resumes. If you're watching on a smaller screen, you may want to maximize the window or make it larger so that it's easier to scan the resumes. But remember that you're not reading through the resumes completely at this stage. You're just taking a quick scan and identifying whether or not you'd want to know more about this applicant. You don't need to remember all of the details. In fact, looking at the resumes quickly will help you to mimic what hiring managers experience as they work. Just take a quick scan of the resume and jot down your very first impressions. The purpose of this activity is to look at resumes through the eyes of hiring managers so that you can better craft your own. If you'd like to look at these resumes more closely later, you can download them from the Resources tab and explore them in more detail after the workshop. Remember, you're writing down one adjective that describes the resume plus a yes or a no on whether you'd want to spend more time looking at it. Are you ready? Here we go. This is OSHA's resume, write down a word or two about your impressions of this resume. Next is Adam's resume, write down your quick impression of it. This is Titus's resume, write down your impressions and order two. Up next is Jason's resume. Here is Lyonna's resume. And finally, he becomes resume. Write your impression. Let's move on to talk about strategies you can use to improve your resume. While there's no right way to write a resume, there are many different resume styles and formats that might be appropriate for the job you're applying for. Today we'll focus on four things you can do to strengthen your resume. One, choose a professional format. Two, highlight your skills and accomplishments. Three, use specific examples in measurable details. And four, tailor your resume to fit the specific job description. We'll return to these sample resumes as examples throughout the workshop. We'll start with choosing a professional format. The format you choose for your resume may depend on the job that you apply for. A traditional resume like OSHA's resume on the left has a standard white background in a classic font and organizational structure. For a more creative feel, you may want to submit a resume with a less traditional design and format like Ibrahim's on the right. This resume uses more colors overall and has unique organizational structure, including career details and two separate columns. As you saw in the quick glist activity, there are many different ways to write a resume and none of them are incorrect. But as you review each resume, you most likely noticed several issues that hiring managers also see during their reviews that can detract from your resume or keeping from moving on to an interview. One of the most important things to remember is that your resume should be professional, organized and easy to read. Having a well-designed resume that is free of errors is extremely important in making a good first impression. If a hiring manager is only spending a few seconds on each resume to decide which ones are worth a second look, you don't want them to be thrown off or get a bad impression just because of formatting or spelling errors. Here are some key attributes to employ when creating a resume. First, be sure to include wide margins and a lot of white space. White space is the space on the page that isn't filled with text or graphics. It gives the reader's eye arrest. Use simple readable language, use clear headings, and choose an appropriate font like aerial or times to Roman. The image on the right shows OSHA's resume. It is a professionally formatted resume with clear headings, a plain font, and wide margins. Contrast of this with Jason's resume, which is packed full of information, and not all of it is relevant to the job position. While Jason may have selected a legible font type, the lack of white space makes the resume a whole really difficult to read. There's no break for the eyes, so the person reading it may feel overwhelmed and distracted rather than impressed. Each of you is multi-talented with different experiences and interests. There is so much that you could add to a resume. But it's important to only include details that are relevant to the position you're applying for. It's usually not necessary to include additional links to social media profiles or websites. Some exceptions here. If you're applying to a position in social media management, you might want to include links to show that you have strong social media following. Some designers, writers, and artists may have a website that includes a portfolio of their work, which can be really helpful. The key here is to include links that are relevant to the job only. The most noticeable challenge with this resume is how difficult it can be to read. Too much information or crowded text can discourage an employer from reading your resume before they even review your experience. Adam's resume, on the other hand, is easier to read than the previous example. There is sufficient white space and the text isn't crowded. But readable white space should be balanced with important information. This resume doesn't include any details about the responsibilities or accomplishments at his previous jobs. Don't assume that the employer reading your resume will know exactly what you did at each job just based on the job title. You also don't want to miss an opportunity to highlight your successful projects, expanded responsibilities, and measurable accomplishments. You still don't have to include every job you've ever done, especially if it isn't relevant to the position you're applying for. If you've been in one career for a long time, add examples and specific details to describe projects and accomplishments. We'll talk about that more in a moment. Sometimes your work experience isn't the only area of your resume where you can showcase the value of your accomplishments. Be creative, think about certifications, awards, volunteer work, part-time jobs, continuing education classes that make you more qualified for the position you're seeking and include those on the resume. You may have found some of the colors and tightestes for a resume distracting. Depending on your industry, it may be accessible for you to use an accent color. However, too many different colors could be distracting to an employer. Also, some of the font types in this resume might be a little difficult to read. It's best to stick to one easily readable font type throughout the entire resume. Depending on your geographic location and the type of job you're applying to, a photo on the resume may or may not be standard practice. Some parts of South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe require candidates to include a photo on the resume. If tightest was applying for, say, a modeling or acting job, a photo might be appropriate. However, even if tightest was applying to a job in one of those regions, he should include a clearer photo than this one. Did you notice typos on this resume? Make sure that you take the time to review your resume for grammatical errors and typos to show an employer that you're detailed oriented. Designing your resume may be a bit intimidating. You may not have many design skills or perhaps you don't feel comfortable formatting digital documents. Fortunately, you don't need design skills to create a professional resume. You can just choose from a variety of pre-built Google resume templates that have already done that for you. Templates are like a pattern that you use as a guide. They provide some design elements and formatting that you can use as a starting point for your projects. They also help you to keep font sizes and styles consistent throughout your document. Google Docs offer lots of free professional resume templates to get you started. The layout, fonts, and colors are different for each template, but they all contain the same basic information that you'll need for a resume. Your contact information, skills, experience, and education as well as accomplishments or projects you've completed. After you select a template, you can customize the document from there. To access these templates, make sure you've signed into your Google account, then go to drive.google.com. Then you want to click new, then select Google Docs, then select from a template. Now choose the template that you like. After the workshop, take a look at some of these templates and think about which one might work best for you. Some of the templates might lead, blend themselves to specific industries. You may want to check with a colleague about standard styles and your individual field. For example, create a person like a graphic designer might use a more creative template to show off their skills even before the interview. We won't go into each template today, but feel free to explore them on your own as you put our other strategies to use. Whether or not you use a template to design your resume, you should at least cover the following categories. Your education, contact information, skills, and of course work experience. Okay, now that we've addressed formatting and first impressions, let's talk about the next strategy that you can use to make your resume more professional, highlighting your skills and accomplishments. Notice this says highlight, not list. You don't want to include everything. Your resume is not a comprehensive list of all the jobs you've ever had or even a list of all the things you've been involved in in the last decade. Your goal is to showcase the skills and accomplishments you have and to make the employer want to call you in for an interview. You want to convince them that you're a good fit for the job you're applying for and they don't need to know everything you've ever done to accomplish that. But hiring managers do want to see the skills and accomplishments that are most relevant to the job you're applying for and they'll likely also want to know the most recent work experience you have. Put the most recent work experience first. Also, don't be afraid to eliminate jobs from your resume that aren't relevant to the one that you're applying for. The experience list does not need to be exhaustive. It needs to highlight the skills and accomplishments that you have that are relevant to this particular job that you're applying for. At the same time, if you've done other activities like part-time jobs or volunteer work that are closely related to the job that you're applying for and you've used or developed skills that would also help that job, definitely include them. If you need to account for a gap in your work history, volunteer work can also be good to show that you are active and developing skills, even if you weren't actively employed. If you're starting a new career, you haven't worked in that field before, examine all the job experience or even life experience that you do have and make the connections wherever you can. Let's practice deciding which opportunities you might include on your resume and which ones you should eliminate. Imagine you're applying for the sales representative position you saw earlier and in the past, you've had the work experiences listed on the left, which include weight staff, cashier, volunteer work, bank teller, babysitting job, and freelance blogging. Take two minutes to review and think about these positions. If you'd like, share in the comment box which jobs you would include on this resume, which you would not and why. As you're working, it may help to also consider which specific projects or measurable details you might include from those positions to show that the past experience is relevant to the job you're applying for. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You Okay, which jobs did you include? Which ones did you decide to leave off? You may have a different opinion than others who are writing in the comments and that's okay. Let's talk about some of the skills we could have pulled from each of these positions and how you might include them on your resume for the sales representative position. The image on the screen identifies a useful skill for each work experience. For a weight staff position, you may have been tasked with upselling customers you were waiting on. Anything from telling them about the desserts to use just to make specific components to their meal could be viewed as an upsell activity. As a cashier, you likely engage with customers for the majority of your work day, a skill that's really important to being a sales representative. Let's say that you raised funds as part of your volunteer work. This experience could be viewed as very similar to that of a sales representative. As a bank teller, you likely had to learn the details of every product or service the bank offered. This was a skill specifically included in the sales representative job description. Even a babysitting job showcases responsibility and multitasking. And freelance blogging work could have required you to negotiate rates for your work with publications or clients. The work is so important in any sales position. Well, you should or shouldn't include in your resume is entirely subjective. Some people may have chosen to include babysitting while others think it doesn't apply. It all depends on the skills you used during that job and how you describe those skills afterward. If you decide not to include some of the jobs or experience that you've had, you could save them to mention in an interview. If you could make a connection to the job you're applying for or you might just leave them out entirely. The main point of this exercise is to show you that you can choose to include or exclude any of the jobs depending on your situation. What is key is how you describe the job and which skills you would highlight. Any of these could have been included in the sales representative resume. If you highlight applicable skills like responsibility, punctuality, customer service, professional attitude, dependable attendance, etc. Also, any could be excluded if you've been in the workforce for a long time and have more professional work experience to cover or if you mentioned the experiences without following with relevant skills. Many people need to take time off from the workforce for a variety of reasons, including caring for loved ones, furthering their education or loss of work due to an economic downturn. If you have a gap in your work history for any reason, whether for months or years, you might want to highlight the education or volunteer work you took part in during that time. You can also describe the experience and skills that you gained through managing a household, learning a new language or core culture, if you traveled or anything else that shows your growth, even when you weren't employed. Another possibility to consider is using a different resume format called a functional resume like the one shown here. In a functional resume, you organize your employment history by experience and skills rather than time order. You can also be a functional resume if most of your experience comes from different short-term jobs or contract work. You can still include your work history, but in a functional resume, it is grouped together and de-emphasized. Hiring managers will focus on the experience and skills that you can bring to the position rather than your work history, including any gaps you might have. No matter which resume format you choose, you should include any continuing education or training you've taken part in. This can include additional coursework at an institutive higher learning, earning a certificate online, or completing workshops like this one. Just be sure that including it will add value to your resume if it relates to the position you're applying for and put it in the resume. You can add these to a subsection of the education section of your resume like you see in this example. Or if your resume is not too long, you can create a new section called professional development or something similar. Include just the basic details for each course or program you completed, the name of the sponsoring school or organization, the title of the course or program, and the date of completion. You can discuss more of what you learned during an interview. You can then easily add to this section anytime you complete a new course or earn a new certificate. Now let's talk about our third strategy. Maybe you have many things to include in your resume, but you don't know which ones to emphasize. How do you make those connections and show the employer that you're right for the job? By using specific examples and measurable details and the descriptions of your work experience to show that you have achieved and accomplished. This is also called showing impact. What specifically have you done and how is it impacted your co-workers, your team, and the company? Lots of people will have words like innovative, organized, efficient, leader, and effective communicator on their resumes. But how can you actually show these qualities instead of just using the phrases? One way is to use specific examples from your previous experience. Describe specific projects that you worked on, improvements that you made, processes you developed, or goals that you attained. Describe the quality of the work you've done in the past and show how it relates to what you could provide to the employer at the new job. The second way is to use measurable details whenever possible to quantify the work you did. For example, you might say that you increased sales at your current job. But what does that mean? Did you increase sales from one widget to two widgets per month or from one widget to one million widgets? Show your impacted numbers whenever possible. This is also a great place to add any awards or recognition that you received. These show how other people have viewed your accomplishments. Let's put this into practice with another challenge. I'm going to show you examples of work experience that you might include on your resume. For each example, list the kinds of measurable details and specific examples you might include if this was your resume. For this resume for the sales representative position, you might include descriptions like manage to team, trained new employees, brand meetings effectively, and sold more than your sales target. But how much to these descriptions really make you stand out to employers? Think about how you could make these skill descriptions more tangible using specific examples and measurable details. You can try rewriting at least one of these descriptions yourself on a piece of paper or a digital document. It's okay to make up the examples and details for now. I'll give you two minutes to try it out. Here's just one example of what your resume might look like once you've added those measurable details. Instead of manage team, you might say manage team of eight employees from new hires to 15 year company members. You might say that you trained 15 employees in two years. You might specify that you ran weekly team meetings and that 20 people typically attended. You can also include details about what those meetings were usually about. And you can be specific about the sales targets you exceeded. Exceeded them by half a percent is very different from exceeding them by 20%. Adding specific examples and measurable details gives employers an idea of just how valuable you will be as an employee. Use numbers like this whenever possible to fully showcase your accomplishments. Let's try another example this time with a volunteer experience. How could you make these skills descriptions more specific using examples and measurable details. It's okay to make up the examples and details for now. Here are some ways you might rewrite the description of your volunteer experience to give hiring managers a better perception of your work. You served meals to over 200 residents and you did that for six months every other week. You also raised $2,000 from local businesses and prepared 200 pounds of food. Your effort is much easier for a hiring manager to imagine here than if you just wrote organized holiday events. You can also apply specific examples and measurable details to a resume if you're shifting your career path within your industry or starting an entirely new career path. More than likely you'll be able to find some transferable skills. These are skills that you acquired in one area that are relevant to an entirely different area. Organization, communication and problem solving are all examples of transferable skills that are vital to just about any profession. In your resume you can make a case that even if you haven't worked in the industry before you have developed these skills in the field and shown success in the kinds of skills and tasks that are needed for the job. Let's say you decide to pursue a career in IT starting as a support technician. Maybe you have experience working in the service industry for a beauty salon. Think about which skills you used in your job and you can include in your resume to show that you have some qualifications despite having no IT experience. You had to manage your daily tasks which shows that you can plan and organize a schedule. You dealt with customers all day long who had different needs so both active listening and multitasking or in your skill set. And you had any managerial responsibilities even if you did not have the title of manager then you might mention leadership skills such as the ability to motivate others and complete shared goals. When you add these skills to your resume include as many specific and measurable details as possible to emphasize how your previous profession can easily translate to your new one. As you write about your skills also use a job posting for the new career you're pursuing to see what language it uses to describe the job responsibilities. So if your posting talks about client work and you refer to the people who visit your customers use clients in your resume instead. This will demonstrate to hiring managers that not only do you possess transferable skills but you also understand how they specifically relate to the new position. The example in this slide shows a few examples. So far we've learned how professional formatting, highlighting skills and accomplishments and sightings, specific examples and measurable details can really make your accomplishments shine. Now our last strategy is to tailor your resume for each job that you're applying to. Earlier we discussed how businesses are using screening or applicant tracking software to narrow the pile of possible candidates before a manager even looks at them. These computer programs scan their resumes for keywords that are in the job description. If those words don't appear often enough in the resume or if the skills you highlight don't match the job description, the program determines that the person is not a good candidate for the position. Even if the employer is not using applicant tracking software, people also tend to scan resumes for keywords. You'll be most successful when your resume matches the language of the job description. When you create a resume for a particular job, you should incorporate as many of the keywords into your past experience and work history as possible. When you describe your past experience using the same terms the employer use in the description, you'll have a better chance of passing screening software. If the company is using it, you'll stand out to the hiring manager and you'll show that you paid close attention to the qualities they want in the candidate. Let's take a moment to complete one more challenge. Re-read the job description we used earlier. Jot down a few words from the job description that you would incorporate into your resume if you were applying for this job position. One tip, pay close attention to the action verbs used in the job description. What will you actually be doing if you get the job? Also, look at characteristics or skills that are mentioned in the description. Take one minute to review this job description and think of words you'd incorporate into your resume. The job description is done. You can use the same terms to create a resume for the job description. If you're using the same terms, you'll have a better chance of passing screening. If you're using the same terms, you'll have a better chance of passing screening. If you're using the same terms, you'll have a better chance of passing screening. If you're using the same terms, you'll have a better chance of passing screening. If you're using the same terms, you'll have a better chance of passing screening. If you're using the same terms, you'll have a better chance of passing screening. If you're using the same terms, you'll have a better chance of passing screening. Okay, what are some of the words you would incorporate into your resume? You might include characteristics like responsible and motivated. Pay attention to action verbs too. For these, you should include specific experiences that illustrate how you did this task in previous jobs. We've identified some words that you could use in your own resume to describe the words you'd incorporate into your resume. You might include characteristics like responsible and motivated. Pay attention to action verbs too. We've identified some words that you could use in your own resume to describe your experience. These include identifying sales needs and delivering sales presentations. Incorporate those same words when you describe your own experience to show that you've done these tasks before. And you'll be successful at doing them for this employer. The action words that are in the job description can help you to shape the skills list for each job and to include measurable details from past work experiences. They also help your resume sound professional without it sounding forced. Let's review our four strategies. In this workshop, we began looking at sample resumes to see what hiring managers look for. Then we examine four strategies for improving your own resume. Choose a professional format. Try to achieve balance so that your resume doesn't look too crowded, too busy, or too empty. Use a template to help with formatting, starting with a resume template can really help. Highlight your skills and experience include only your most relevant and recent experiences. Sight specific examples and measurable details clearly and completely explain your achievements and skills rather than just mentioning them. Finally, tailor your resume to the job you want. Use words for the job description to impress resume screening programs and employers. You can use these strategies as a checklist for revising your own resume. Take a few minutes to think about what strategies seem most useful to you. There are many other digital tools that can help you with the job application process as well. We've already mentioned resume templates to lighten the lift of designing a professional looking resume. Here's another way to use digital tools to help you organize information for your resume. Use a digital document to keep a running list of all the things you might consider under work experience. That might include part time and full time jobs, side work, you do around the neighborhood, clubs, organizations through your purchase paid end, volunteer work, and many other things. You can update a digital document like this at any time from any device that is connected to the internet. That way, when you go to write or update your resume, you don't have to spend a lot of time thinking about all the things that you did in the past. You'll have a complete list to pull from. The section of a digital document on screen is a list of work experience applicable to a sales associate position. Another digital tool is to use a digital spreadsheet to track your application process. This slide shows a Google Sheets spreadsheet. As you apply to different jobs or find out about positions you'd like to apply to, you can track those in a spreadsheet. The job search plan on this screen shows a job search plan that can help you to compare different positions, companies, and salaries. If you're applying to many jobs, you can also use a spreadsheet like this to keep track of the different versions of your resume and to track the status of each application. For example, you can add a list for, have not started the application submitted, scheduled interview, send thank you note, to remind yourself where you are with each application and what tasks you need to complete. Finally, you could create a digital portfolio in Google Slides like the one shown on this slide for photography and sound engineering. When you build these projects in Google Docs, Sheets or Slides, you can access them from any device with Google applications. They save automatically so you don't have to worry about losing your work, even if your computer crashes. And you can share the projects to collaborate from anywhere. At this point, we've given you several strategies and digital tips. So before we go, let's talk about next steps. Here are a few ways to move forward with the information you learned today. First, review possible resume templates in the Google Docs template gallery. Choose one that suits your industry experience and even style. Examinate your current resume and find places to include specific examples and measurable details. And finally, create a running list of experiences that you can use to tailor your resume.

Thank you all for joining us for improved resume with practical strategies. This wraps up the presentation portion of today's workshop. Now give us just a few moments to pass it off to Bacine who will answer some of the questions you submitted. Thanks Anna. Hey everyone, I'm Bacine and I'm excited to answer a few of the questions that you've asked throughout the session today. As usual, we received quite a few of them. Remember, if we don't get to your question, we'll go back and answer all of them on the growth Google on their page. Be low of the virtual event shortly after it concludes. Okay, on to the first question, which is from George. In George wants to know, does my resume have to only be one page? And then so we talk about that. It's, you know, seven applicants can add more than one page for the resume for every 10 years of work experience. But this of course can be different for everyone. However, because we can't guarantee that the hiring manager will actually go past that first page. We do recommend that that first page be as impactful as possible to really encourage that that hiring manager to read past that first page if necessary. One thing to kind of think about is if keeping your resume to one page means that you must reduce the font or that margin size. It would actually be best to go to two pages as an employer may not of course be, may want to read on a simply overcrowded resume. Okay, so next question is from Iman. I want to know, would recruit us prefer having just essential sections in a resume, you know, education, work experience, etc. I've seen several successful resumes with extra sections like attributes, most proud of, etc. And wanted to know if they work effectively in a resume. Great question, I'm on. So this will of course all be up to recruit it right and like what they prefer not all recruiters feel the same about, you know, the same different resume formats. Somebody feel overwhelmed by too much information and some actually may want more information. So we don't know what will work for every recruiter than it's best to go with what you feel really is going to work for you. And if it's not working, you're not getting results you're looking for, then you may want to look into making some changes as you go along. So the next question here is from Zoe in Zoe once I know she says I'm a visual designer and I don't have many quantitative facts on my resume except side activities such as speaking at a conference. How do I navigate selling myself without numbers? And that's a good question Zoe and you actually may actually have more metrics than you realize, right? So think about things like like what about the volume of projects over a specified period of time? What about the reach of those projects on the size of the actual companies or the audience that you're actually reaching with their work. So like when you don't have quantitative metrics, the qualitative descriptions can also be impactful as well. Okay, next question here is from Marcus Marcus wants to know how do you pack in all the information you wish to convey to a potential player without making the resume look so busy and cluttered. And so great question Marcus and the thing is that you actually don't want to pack it all in right. It's not about what you want to convey. It's about what the employer wants to see. So put yourself in their shoes and modify that resume according to what will offer the most value to that employer to know that you are the right person for the job. Okay, next question here is from Bonnie. Bonnie wants to know any preference to PDF over word. Hey, Bonnie. So there is no preference on our side, but one thing to note is that PDFs, they're the same with every screen without, you know, any formatting or compatibility issues like because it's a global standard from a word standpoint that you may run its issues from one machine to another or maybe someone actually having, you know, word on their machine. So PDFs would probably give you the best chance of being compatible across all machines and all devices, but really there's no preference on our side. Next one is from Flynn. If you held the same position at different companies and all your job responsibilities were exactly the same. Do you repeat job descriptions for each with the same text? That's a good question Flynn. And you really should try to diversify your descriptions. You know, what's like differences in your skills or experience that you've actually learned across all those different jobs, even though you may have held the same position, you've had different responsibilities at those different companies and you want to show the growth that you made. So definitely make an effort to make them, you know, of course, make the description is different and more importantly highlighting your growth over time. Next question here from Henry Henry has a formatting question. So he says some employers request resume in word format. We just talked about this. How remind us in Google docs will this be an issue and you tips help. That's actually a really good question. So wait, we of course we just talked about using the Google Doc template. How do I get that into word or PDF format? And so what you want to do is once you get your resume, that way you want when it comes to submitting it, you can actually go to the file menu and then click on download. And then from there you have a whole bunch of different choices and two of those choices are, you know, word or PDF. And that's how you can get that out of that Google format into word or PDF. All right, last question here is from Asha. Asha wants to know how important are listing references on a resume is that old school. So resumes references are important on your resume not only resume but references are important to have at your disposal. Some employers may want that and somebody not, but the key is that you actually do have those first sentences ready to go just in case when asked do you have including your resume probably not. But it's very important to understand that especially a lot of recruiters will want those references for just in case right. Okay, so that wraps up this Q&A for today.

Before I jump in, I want to invite all of you to take a moment to get centered and decompress. Some of you are here because you're looking for a new career or in the process of switching careers. Transitions like this can be stressful. So no matter what brings you here today, we want you to start from a place of clarity in relaxation. So now I'm going to give you just a few moments to breathe. Take three deep, slow breaths. And if you like, you can even close your eyes. Imagine yourself five or ten years from now. You're getting ready for your workday, knowing you're preparing to go to a job you love. You find your work fulfilling. You see the impact it makes on your community. And you really enjoy the people you get to spend time working with. Let yourself sit in this feeling for another three long deep breaths. Then open your eyes. The steps we're about to take in this workshop are going to help you make this feeling a daily reality. It all starts with creating your career plan to get the job that you want. Now that you've gotten a moment to get centered, let me give you a quick overview of this workshop. Over the next 45 minutes, I'll take you through the process of starting a career plan that will give you a roadmap to building the career that you want. First, we'll talk about what a career plan is and how creating one will benefit you. Next, you'll look at your skills, experience, and background to help decide on a long-term career goal. After that, you'll identify the requirements for meeting your long-term goal. In this step, you'll also take a look at the skills and experience you already have, which you can apply to your goal. Then you'll decide on milestones that will help keep you on track to meet your goal. Finally, you'll learn how to create smart goals, which will allow you to take concrete steps to hold yourself accountable as you move toward your long-term career goal. First, let's talk about the concept of a career plan. A career plan is a document you create to map out your future career path step by step. It shows each goal that you need to meet in order to get the career that you want. In this workshop, you'll create a career plan and the workbook that we've provided. A good career plan allows you to assess where you currently are in your career and determine how to meet your future goals. It's also a timeline that helps you build the career that you want by breaking your major goals and two small actionable steps. Everyone's career plan will look totally different, depending on the job and educational experience they currently have, where they currently are in their career and their eventual goals. The career plan that you'll make in your workbook is just a version of a career plan. Feel free to experiment with your plan in a new document once you've completed the workbook. Career plans help at any stage of your career, whether you're just starting off looking for a new job, changing careers or industries, hoping to get a promotion, or changing your current role to be a better fit for your skills and desires. In this workshop, you'll start building a career plan for yourself. You'll build your career plan in the workbook we've created for this lesson. You can access the workbook in the resources section below the video player or via an online link that I'll share in a few minutes. Even if you know exactly what your long term goals are, you won't have all the information or time that you need to complete this plan in the next hour. And that's okay. You may not even know what you want to do for your career. That's okay too. We've provided you with a workbook that will help guide you through developing a career plan during the workshop. But after our time together, you can keep using the workbook to add to or even change your career plan completely. Think about your career goals. For many people, terrific career is made up of several elements. It's what you love to do after all you'll be doing it for the majority of your day and most of the days of your life. It's an area where you've developed skills or expertise. It's something that you get paid enough to do and it's something that the world needs. It may not be realistic or even desirable for you to find a career where all of these elements are perfectly balanced. For example, you may be at a point in your life where what I get paid for is the most important thing to you and your family. So maybe your interests, strengths and the world's needs are not as important. Maybe you can determine the right balance between these goals or if there are even the right or if these are even the right motivation for your own career path. Whatever your ideal career looks like for you, create a career plan to make your ideal reality. People rarely fall into an ideal career right out of school. Creating the career you want takes careful goal setting and planning. We won't take time to do that right now but on page three of your workbook is a place for you to reflect on your career goals and the life motivations that shape your work. It's also good to keep in mind that your career plan is likely to change with time. You may find that your career desires change or you need to make adjustments to your career plan based on life circumstances. I encourage you to think of your career plan as a living document. Use it to set your goals and figure out your timing and then be willing to make adjustments when things in your life or whatever or whenever you might realize you want something different than you originally planned. The first step towards a career plan is understanding what kind of work you want to be doing. For many people this is the most challenging aspect of developing a career plan so we're going to take some time with this step. This workshop will help you identify skills that you already have. Think of career careers that require those skills, identify your career goals and then help you build a plan for getting there. You'll also spend some time thinking about skills you already have so that you can take stock of how they might help you achieve the career you want. Even if you're not able to identify your ultimate career goal in the next four year or so minutes, you'll learn techniques you can use to get closer to a decision. To get started on a career plan, open the workbook from the Resources tab. You can print out this document and fill it out by hand or you can work in it digitally in your Google account. Your workbook will be saved automatically in your Google Drive so you can return to it any time to edit your career plan or just to get back on track. To work in the digital document, sign into your Google account. If you don't have one, don't worry. You can sign up for one now. To open the workbook, visit g.co-scrrro-career-workbook. If you're joining us from on air, click on the link in the Resources tab. Then rename your copy of the workbook. This workbook contains more content than we'll be able to cover today. You'll find reflection questions and about your current employment, your career goals, and so forth. You'll be able to access your workbook in your Google Drive whenever you're signed into your Google account. So you can keep working on your career plan after the workshop is over. And if you ever decide to create a new version of your career plan, make a copy of your workbook and start fresh. We all bring years of experience and skills with us into the workforce. This is true even if you've never had a job before. In this section, we'll spend some time exploring the things that you've done and learned and figure out how you might apply those experiences toward your future career. As we go through the next slides, make sure to take some notes in your workbook. First think about the previous jobs that you've had. We're going to take a look at the tasks that you've performed and those jobs to get a bigger picture of the experience that you're bringing into your career. Start with one job for now. But after the workshop, it's a good idea to repeat this step for all of your past jobs. On the top of page four of your workbook, write down one job or experience that you've had. Remember that your work experience doesn't just include paid work. It can include volunteer opportunities, internships, school activities, or any other position you've held that gave you valuable skills and experience. Below the space where you wrote the job, write down a list of the tasks you performed when you held that job. A task is an assignment or a duty that you performed as part of that job. For example, what are the things that you needed to do as part of this job? Be sure to think about daily tasks in addition to bigger tasks that took longer periods of time. In addition, write down notable things that you accomplished when you were in that job. What are the things that you're most proud of that you did while you were working that job? What are the things that you worked hard on? In addition to writing down the tasks that you performed, be sure to also mention the impact that you had on that job and be as specific as possible. For example, if you worked in sales, did your sales numbers improve over time? If you were in management, did you improve the morale or performance of your employees? How was that reflected in your team's performance? I'll give you a moment to jot down a few things, but you can always come back to this later. Now let's talk about skills. How skills are abilities that allow you to succeed in a particular job? Keep in mind that skills are different from tasks. Task for things that you do and skills are the things that you've learned. Once you've gained a new skill, you can take it with you to all of your future jobs. You acquire job skills at work or in a training or educational setting. Some skills may also come from activities you perform outside of work, like volunteer work or hobbies. Look back at the job you listed under experience. You wrote about the tasks you performed as part of the job. Now start to think about some of the skills you gained performing those tasks. Keep in mind there are lots of different types of skills and they're all valuable. So include different types of skills. For example, interpersonal skills, like communicating well, helping teammates manage conflict or running a great meeting. Different skills, like making sure a group's tasks are accomplished on time and on budget or working with direct reports. Technical skills, your ability to work with the tools required for the job, whether you work in a laboratory or a construction site or on an airplane. Problem solving skills, which is figuring out solutions to issues that arise at work. And marketing and sales, your ability to sell an idea or product effectively. On page four, you'll also see space to list your skills. Take one minute to write down as many of your job skills as you can. Since we're moving quickly today, come back to this section after the workshop and add an example of a specific moment on the job when you've used each skill. Specific examples are great to use in job interviews or other career related conversations. Now look over the list you made in your workbook, which tasks did you enjoy? Highlight those. Highlight any of the accomplishments that you are particularly proud of or that you feel especially showcase your strengths. Also take note of any task that felt more like chores or that you found stressful. If you want, you can select those tasks and put a strike through them. While you may not be able to completely avoid tasks that you dislike in the future, being aware of your likes and dislikes can help you to select jobs that you're more likely to enjoy. Then take a step back to review. Note any patterns that emerge. Perhaps many of the tasks are collected around a common theme. This might be a clue to a future career path that you'd actually enjoy or a task that you should feature predominantly in your future career. Or to come back to this activity after the workshop to complete this process for more of your past jobs. Duplicate this page for each of the major jobs or experiences you've had. Also, feel free to include volunteer positions and internships or even hobbies. All your experiences can help you get a better understanding of the kind of work that's most well suited for you. In addition to skills you gained on the job, you've gained skills on your educational journey. Whether you study subjects that inform your work or you participate in training programs, your educational and training background can contribute to your career possibilities. Take a few moments to write down the job-related education and training that you've received so far. You can find this in your workbook on page 5. For many people figuring out their long-term career goal is the biggest challenge of creating your career plan. Now that you've identified your skillset, the skills and tasks you most enjoy, and thought about your educational and training history, you can start thinking about your long-term goal. Some of these questions might help you clarify your goal. What would you like to be doing five years from now? What kind of work do you enjoy? Think about what industries you like to work in, but also which working conditions you prefer. Do you like working alone or as part of a team? Do you like a structured work environment or a lot of flexibility? What problems or issues in the world do you want to help fix? If you know your long-term goal, go ahead and write it in your workbook on page 6. If you don't know yet, reflect on some of these questions for now. If you're still not sure of your long-term goal, that's okay. I recommend setting aside time after the workshop to brainstorm about what you like to do, your skills, talents, and past experiences, and how you might use those to build a career. Go back to the list of tasks you've enjoyed and past jobs, and use that to help you think of something you might want to do in the future. Talk to people who know you well, and ask them what they think you'd be great doing. If you have access to a career counselor, they can also be really helpful. In order to move forward with this workshop, choose a career that you think you could pursue and write it in your workbook so that you can learn how to apply your existing skills to the pursuit of a new career, and then eventually build out your career plan. Once you know your long-term career goal, the next step is to start figuring out what's required to achieve that goal. You can't tackle it all at once. This is where your career plan really starts to take shape. In this section, you'll figure out what you need to do to reach your goal. We'll start by evaluating which skills, experiences, and training you already have, and can apply to that goal. If you're not sure about educational requirements for a job that you want, try searching for a job posting for that role, or a similar one. The exact requirements for a job may vary from one company to the next, so it's a good idea to look at a few different postings. Look at headings like qualifications, experience, or education. You can also be helpful to keep in mind that the qualification section of a job posting is not necessarily a list of absolute requirements. It can also be more like an employer's wish list. Often job listings will have a list of required qualifications alongside preferred ones, which will give you a better sense of which skills are just on the employer's wish list. You don't have to meet every single requirement to be qualified for a job. For example, a company may say they're looking for someone with a master's in business administration. Maybe you don't have an MBA, but you did start and run your own company for several years. Apply for that job anyway. Mention your business experience and see if you can get an interview. I'm spending time on this point because applying for jobs even when you think you don't meet all of the requirements can make a big difference in your ultimate career success. That difference shows starkly along gender lines. Internal study at Hugh Packard showed that men working would apply for jobs if they had 60% of the required qualifications. Meanwhile, women would only apply for jobs if they met 100% of the qualifications. Remember skills and experiences you already have may be enough for you to get hired for a job and succeed in it. So before you sign up for a new educational or training program, take some time to identify the skills, education, and experience you already have and see how you can pitch those to an employer. As you pursue your ultimate career goal, it's important to look at the skills and experience you've already gained during your career and education. Chances are you'll be able to apply some of those to your goal. Transferable skills are skills training and education from a previous job that you can use in a new position, even if the nature of the new job is different from the old one. For example, restaurant servers have strong communication skills. Communication is a transferable skill that can be applied to any workplace and almost every job will require good communication skills. Let's look at a few people who are looking to make career transitions and discuss how their current job skills can apply to the job they want to transition to. Consider this question and then type your answer in the comment box. Alejandra is a hotel manager who wants to transition to a career in project management in the tech industry. In her current role, she helps with hotel hiring and makes sure the right people are staffed in different jobs. She spends time working with maintenance staff and housekeeping to make sure rooms are cleaned and repaired by certain deadlines. She works with event planners to make sure large group events run smoothly and that guests have all they need. So which of these skills might make her a good project manager? Go ahead and type your answer in the comment box. That may have been a trick question because these are all skills that Alejandra might be able to apply to project management job in the tech field. Okay, here's another one. Consider this question and then type your answer in the comment box. Staff is a customer service manager who wants to apply for a role as a data analyst. In his current job, he helps run the customer support operations of a retail business with customer support, managing a team of phone support representatives in his office as well as online chat support representatives overseas. He tracks customer satisfaction surveys for both teams to see how his teams are performing and determines where improvements are needed. Once he presents the information to his boss, he's often asked implement changes to his team's customer service strategy. What of these tasks and skills might make him a good candidate for a job as a data analyst? Type your answer in the comment box. We know that Jeff's already analyzing data in his current job by working with surveys and deciding and analyzing where to make improvements. His experience managing a team of people internationally and implementing changes to his team's strategy don't speak directly to his skills and data analysis, but this leadership experience and ability to pivot gracefully will be welcomed by any future employer. Now let's take a few moments to write some notes on page 8 of your workbook, which transferable skills do you have that could help you reach your career goals? Think about the job or career path that you selected. Consider what skills the job will require and then think back to the skills you identified on page 3 that you already have. If you get stuck, think about more universal skills like management skills, communication skills and problem solving, which of these do you accept that? Which do you particularly enjoy? Now that we've thought about the skills you're going to have, let's talk about gaining new ones. What sort of education or training will you need to meet your career goal? This can mean going back to school or taking classes, but it can also mean talking to people, reading articles or books or getting certifications. It could also mean studying any language or gaining technical skills like coding. Grow with Google offers career certificates that can give you a path to end-of-man jobs of the top employers that are currently hiring in the industries that we talked about, data analytics, project management and more. You can learn more at grow.google slash certificates. Beyond educational requirements, many career goals will require you to bring specific experiences into a new job. Here's a short list of some of the most in-demand skills in the workforce right now. Sales leadership, project management, UX design, analysis, video production, marketing, collaboration and time management. Depending on the career you want, you may need to gain experience managing employees or building your sales skills or speaking in front of other people. You may need strong written communication skills or experiencing managing projects. You can learn more about the experience required for a specific job and the same way you learned about the educational requirements by reading job descriptions. Take a few moments now to write down any experiences, training or education that you'll need to achieve your career goal on page 9 of your workbook. In this section, you'll start building out your actual career plan. You've already identified what you want to do. You picked a goal. You've identified transferable skills and education. You already have. They can help you get that goal. You've also figured out what education, training and experiences you need to achieve that goal. Now let's talk about how to create the rest of your career plan. How do you get from knowing what you need to do to actually accomplishing these goals by breaking down your goals into smaller pieces called milestones? A milestone is a significant event that will need to happen or an accomplishment that you'll need to achieve before you reach your goal. Depending on your career goal, those milestones might be gaining a new skill, completing a training program or hitting a certain performance metric at your current job. For example, if your career goal is to find a job as a project manager, your milestones might be to complete a project management certificate, network with other project managers, create a project proposal, and run the project while managing a team. Once you accomplish as milestones, you may feel like you have enough experience to apply for a job. Take a moment to think about your long-term career goal. On page 11, write down some of the milestones for your career plan. What will you need to accomplish to reach the career that you want? By this point, you've chosen your career goal and identified the skills you already have and what you still need. You've identified the big steps that you'll need to take to reach your career goal, those are your milestones, but you don't achieve milestones all at once. It's also important to break those milestones into smaller, achievable goals. Let's talk briefly about how to create effective goals. Using the Smart acronym, you can help ensure that your goals are useful. A Smart goal meets the following requirements. It's specific. It describes the exact goal that you want to achieve. It's measurable, so you know exactly when you've reached your goal. It's actionable. A goal you can actually achieve and do something about. It's relevant, in this case, relevant means the goal gets you closer to achieving your career goals, and it's time-bound. You need to achieve your goal by a specific date. You should keep track of all the dates in your career plan workbook, but you can also write them down in your calendar. Now, let's look at some examples of good smart goals. Take a look at these two examples. Complete Google Career Certificate course by May 15th of next year, and get a promotion to manager. Which of these is a smart goal? Type your answer in the comment box. If you wrote that the first goal is a smart goal, you're right. It's specific. You know exactly what you need to do. It's measurable. You will know when the goal is complete. It's actionable. You can sign up for the course now and take it. It's relevant. If the goal fits in with your current career plan, then it's relevant. And it's time-bound. You know you have to complete the course by a specific date. Now get promoted to manager is not a smart goal for a few reasons. While it is specific, measurable, and relevant, it's not necessarily actionable. You can do whatever is necessary to qualify for the promotion, but actually getting the promotion is likely out of your control. This goal is also not time-bound. It's just that to happen sometime in the future. But is the goal for the promotion going to happen this year? Is it going to happen in five years? Ten years? You don't know. To create a smart goal, you might look instead at the accomplishments you would need to be considered for that promotion. And those are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound. They may be great smart goals for your career path. Reflect on the milestones you wrote in your workbook. Think about the smaller goals that you'll need to accomplish for each milestone. On page 12 of your workbook, write one milestone at the top of the page. Then create a smart goal for meeting that milestone. I'll line how that goal is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound. Take some time now to practice this with one goal for one milestone. In your career plan, you'll probably have many goals for each milestone and many milestones for reaching your long-term career goal. Great job writing a smart goal. Your final career plan may be made up of dozens of smaller goals. And you may still find it useful to break those goals into even smaller sub-goals. It's much easier to meet your goals when you break them down into their component parts and to make each part specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound, just like we did here. Congratulations. You've now completed a career plan. Remember, you can always return to your career plan and make updates as your career continues to grow and evolve. Let's recap all that you've done in the past 45 minutes. It was a lot. During our time together, you learned all about career plans. Next, you looked at your skills, experience, and backgrounds to help you decide on a long-term career goal. After that, you identified the requirements for meeting your long-term goal and found transferable skills and education that can help you reach that goal. Then you decided on milestones that will help keep you on track to meet your goal. Finally, you learned about smart goals, which will allow you to take concrete steps and hold yourself accountable as you move towards your long-term career goal. After this workshop, return to your workbook and complete your career plan. Reflect more on the initial questions we discussed. What are your motivations for your career and in life? What experiences have you already had that you want to be doing more of in your career? You may want to duplicate the work experience pages to reflect on the jobs and volunteer opportunities you've been part of in the past. Reflect on your tasks, accomplishments, and skills, and think about which ones might be transferable to the new career you want to pursue. If you're still undecided about your career path, do some research and reflection. Deciding what you want to do is often the most difficult part. You can start by searching the internet for jobs that you use skills that you already have and then involve the tasks that you enjoy. It also helps to set up informational interviews with people in a career field that you find interesting. Once you settle on a career, set aside plenty of time to complete your career milestones and goals. If you're looking for a job or career change, pull out your resume and edit it to highlight the skills you have that align with the career or goal that you want. Remember, you don't have to meet every qualification in a job description, so give yourself a shot. If you enjoy your job that you want to grow in your career, use your career plan to have a proactive discussion with your manager. You can show them your workbook or you can use it as a way to structure your conversation. Let your manager know the kinds of work that you enjoy and the kind of work that saps your energy. Remind them of your skills and strengths and let them know that you're interested in taking on new challenges and stretch opportunities. Sharing your career goals with your manager and those around you will not only help you stay on track, but will also help them find you opportunities that will help you on your career path. Three of our Grow with Google Partners shared some additional interview tips for today's workshop. From Langston University, keep an open mind when exploring new opportunities. Some of the best opportunities exist in fields or industries that you might not have considered. From Douglas County Public Libraries.

Now, I'll give us just a few moments to pass it off to the seam who will answer some of the questions you submitted. Thanks, Anna. Hey, everyone. I'm Bessie. I'm excited to answer a few of the questions you've asked throughout the session. And as usual, we received quite a few of them. Remember, if we don't get to, your questions will go back and answer all of them on the growth Google on their page. Below their virtual event shortly after it concludes. All right, here our first question is from Susan. Susan wants to know can networking help me to reach my career goals faster. So absolutely Susan, connecting with people who can support you and your career goals can definitely move you towards those career goals much faster. So like when it comes to how to best network, you want to consider environments that you shine in. So for example, if you're really outgoing, you might thrive in networking clubs. If you're more introverted, you might prefer all my organizations that actually organize virtual events for you, where you've been considered things like one on one's, coffees with people in your network. But really, you want to ask yourself, where are you your best self for this first except? All right, so next question here is from Don. Don wants to know what if I don't have any experience in the career I want to be in. That's a great question, Don. So just to add on to what Anna has discussed as far as pulling out the skills that you can transfer to that new career, you can also focus on exposing yourself to new skills. So taking classes like this one, for instance, or getting a Google certification, volunteer with organizations that are related to that industry that you're interested in, connecting with others in the similar field, just basically take as many steps as you can towards gaining more experience in that new chosen career field. Next question here is from Sarah. Sarah wants to know how much are the Google certificates? Well, that's a good question. And when we talk about certificates, the cost is really going to be a how much time you take. For the most part, the certificates are based on a monthly subscription. And I remember the actual prices, but that monthly subscription, as much time you take, you can take to take that any particular course. So Delphi, you want to check out, I've grown that Google's last certificates for more information. It's also important to note that there is a free one month trial period to kind of get you started over that. I also love that some of the courses actually are free to take the course, but there will be a fee for the actual certification exam. So just definitely check out grow.google slash certificates for more information that get the exact number you are looking for. All right. Next one here is from Hugh. Where should I organize my career plan? And so when you talk about that, you want to make sure you organize your career plan somewhere that is easily accessible so that it can be changed without much trouble. So it's likely you will continue to make your updates on your career plan on the go. So really having it in a digital document, something like Google Docs or Google Sheets really makes sense. And that way you can access it from anywhere anytime on any device that you're looking for. All right. Next question here is from Jesse. All right. Jesse says, at 46, I would like to transition into a more tech-based field. I'm starting to look at coding in some other areas. Your career is as high education English and claims adjusting right out of college. How do people find maybe a mentor so you can make sure you are on the right path to the right job. And that's a really interesting question to Jesse. So when you talk about the touch on this a little bit before, but there are plenty of places like social groups. You can check LinkedIn or Facebook for forums where you can go and use for networking and then actually finding a mentor in that field that you're looking to transition into. It's also important to note like when I kind of think about myself, I have all my mentors I've found naturally. This is something that I find that best occurs organically or naturally as opposed to looking for a mentor. You'll find that, you know, just as you start to find your career path and you're on your way to, you know, taking courses, just upskilling and getting information you need that you will discover that mentor along the way. As long as you're, you know, moving forward and really looking for information, that will usually happen. At least for me, it's happened very naturally. So yes, you can go searching for a mentor, but most likely that mentor will find you. All right. Next question here is from Steven. Hello, I am a recent graduate of Texas A and University right now. I am looking for job. But I'm having issues with looking for that perfect job for me. But I do not know where to start looking. I've been using media like LinkedIn, Glastor, but I am deciding on maybe looking for jobs in a different career field. All right. So, hey, Steven, it's important to consider not only what fields you might want to be in, but also the things that are most important to you personally. So like, for example, where do you want to live, right? What type of work environment do you want? Do you want something where you interact with, you know, people consistently or that requires more independent work? This can really kind of help you to narrow things on a lot. And really, like, I see you just graduated. So like on top of that, as a new grad, you may find that you are switching careers a bit or a lot in the beginning, as you start to get to understand what it's like to be out there in the workforce. And then really understand what it is that works for you. So it's okay to not know exactly what you want in the beginning. And of course, you can change your mind later. You'll find that most people do not go right out of college until the same job and continue that same job. Some people change careers completely because they final that really this is not great. All right. And it looks like here I have last questions from Tracy. Tracy says, but does applying for a position without all of the requirements work for those who want certifications, slash licenses? So I think for Tracy's asking is, you know, for those people, those positions that are asking for specific certifications, is it okay to apply for those if you actually don't have those? And so we talk about that really unless it explicitly says certification or whatever particular skill set is required doesn't hurt to apply. The worst that can happen is that you get rejected due to the lack of certifications or experience for that job. Right. I mean, it's a worst that can happen. You know, what else can happen is you can actually get the job. But if you don't apply for that job, you have zero chance at all of actually landing the job. So it doesn't hurt to give it a try. All right. So that is it. I've up to our Q&A for today. Thank you all for joining us for a create a career plan to get the job you want. Hopefully everyone learned something new.

If the words job interview make you feel a little nervous, you're definitely not alone. But it's important to remember that an interview is more than a hurdle between you and your next job. An interview is a chance to speak with and potentially learn from someone and feel that interest you. It's an opportunity to hear directly from someone about what it's like to work in this field to discover how their team functions and how their company does business. A great interview can benefit your career whether or not you land the job because it allows you to make new contact. So even if one position isn't quite the perfect fit, it can lead you to another one that will be. Plus, you'll be able to meet people who might become mentors or who can introduce you to someone else who will have that perfect role. It's also important to remember that asing your interview isn't actually about getting everything perfect. The best interviews are about connecting with your interviewers and making it clear how much you have to offer their team. The best way to connect is to relax and be fully present during the interview itself. In this workshop, you'll learn several ways to accomplish that goal. During this workshop, we're going to discuss steps that you can take to make sure that you start your next interview feeling really confident and ready to connect. To do that, we've divided up this presentation the three major sections. Prepare where we'll walk you through the steps you'll need to get yourself ready for your interview. Practice where you'll learn about an exciting new tool that will help you to practice interviewing as well as tips for doing mock interviews with a friend and be present where you'll learn tips to keep yourself calm, cool, and collected during the interview so you can clearly communicate the value that you bring to a new job, team, or company. First, let's talk about preparing for your interview. The more thorough your preparation, the more relaxed and present you can be during your actual interview. In this section, you'll learn how to research the company, figure out what questions you're likely to be asked, craft a concise elevator pitch to introduce yourself, prepare questions for your interviewer, and to make sure you're physically and mentally ready for your interview. The first and maybe the most important thing you can do to prepare for an interview is research. Your research will help you to make an informed and compelling case for how you can contribute to the company and why they should hire you. This slide shows a diagram with five ways to research a job, company website, social media, professional networking sites, news articles, and friends, family, social networks. As you research, take notes about what you learn so you can refer to them before your interview. Start with the company's official website. Read over as much of the site as possible, focusing especially on the company's mission and values. What are they seeking to accomplish in the world and how can you contribute to that mission? If you can read about the people you're interviewing with or the department where you're planning to interview and check for recent news or announcements. Next, check the company's social media accounts and see how they manage their public image online. How do they connect with their users? Are there any social or philanthropic issues that the company supports? Then find the company on professional networking sites. Some sites even have anonymous employee reviews so you can get an inside perspective of what it's like to work there. Some of these sites like Glassdoor will even have information from people who have interviewed for jobs at the company, including sample interview questions. Professional networking sites like LinkedIn can also be a great place to search for more details about the hiring manager or other people that you know you will be interviewing with. Seeing their work history and background may help you find connections or understand their areas of expertise so you can better anticipate their questions. Search for recent news articles about the company. These can give you a sense of challenges that the company is facing and how its actions are impacting the greater community. See whether anyone in your friends, family or social network is able to introduce you to someone who works at the company or in a related field. Then you can reach out to this person and request an informational interview in which you can ask them questions about their experience working for the company or in the field. Being able to speak to the company's goals will show a perspective employer that you're truly interested in the company and in performing well in the job. It will also give you a deeper connection with your potential employer and make sure that your values and strengths align with the company's missions and values. There are two common styles of interview questions that you should be prepared for. Behavioral and situational. Behavioral is when an interviewer asks you how you handle the situation in the past from your work history or experience. For example, tell me about a time when you overcame an obstacle. Situational is when an interviewer asks you about a hypothetical situation in the future. For example, if you are a new leader on the project, how would you get yourself and your new team set up for success? We will talk more about the best way to answer these types of questions. Because behavioral questions focus on a past experience, you want to include plenty of details and data to support your answer. You can try preparing answers that include these four areas. Situation, task, action, and results. Sometimes this is referred to as star. Be prepared to describe the situation, the task you were directly responsible for, the action you took, and then the results that you achieved with as much detail as possible. Instead of saying something like, I increased sales, it would be better to say I increased sales by 20% this year by reaching and converting new leads. Let's dig into our previous example of a situational question. If you are a new lead on a project, how would you get yourself and your new team set up for success? It's important to answer this question with specific examples of actions you would take. For example, I would first want to determine what our key objectives are and how we're measuring success. I would then clarify our resources, determine roles and responsibilities, and then set important milestones to reach our goal. It can also be useful to again think about examples from your past where you encountered similar situations. In my last role, I set my team up for success by making sure we all had daily and weekly goals to track progress. Make sure to show your potential employer how the two situations are related and how what you learned from your previous situation gives you better insight and experience for this hypothetical situation. Something like, the goals wouldn't be the same at this company, but the process for establishing and reporting on them would be the same. I've learned that the team is more engaged when everyone can provide input on the goals and when we track them in a place where everyone can see. In addition to practicing behavioral and situational interview questions, you can also find other sample interview questions online that are specific to the type of job you're applying for. For example, if you search the web for data and a list interview questions, hundreds of results will come up. Even if the job you're applying to is less common, give it a try. If you're having trouble getting results for the job you want experiment with different search terms or search for interview questions within the industry that you're interested in. There are also commonly asked interview questions that aren't specific to any particular field, which employers use to get a sense of who you are and how you might approach your work. These are questions like, what is your greatest strength and biggest area for improvement? Where do you see yourself in five years? Why are you leaving your current job? How do you deal with stressful situations? Do you prefer working on your own or with a team? Once you have an idea of the questions you might be asked, you have the advantage of being able to practice your answers. We'll talk more about that in the practice section of the workshop. For now, let's talk about how to handle one of the most common and most surprisingly difficult interview questions out there. Tell me about yourself. While it's not technically a question, this prompt is often the first thing a potential employer asks you. I'm going to give you 20 seconds to answer it right now, out loud, the way you would in an interview. Don't think about it too hard. Just do your best. Tell me about yourself. It's not always easy to mention the most relevant details when you're asked such a broad question. That's why we're going to spend a little time talking about your elevator pitch, which is a quick summary of what you have to offer. The term elevator pitch comes from the idea that if someone stepped into an elevator with you, you could introduce yourself and give an idea of what you have to offer before the elevator arrived at its destination. An elevator pitch allows you to introduce yourself and what you have to offer early in the interview. You can lead with the information you're proud of, and that will be most interesting to the employer. Here are a few tips for a successful elevator pitch. You don't need to memorize it verbatim, but you should practice and become familiar with the main points to make sure that you share the information that's most important to you. It should be around 30 to 60 seconds long. Your pitch should include these three components, who you are, what you do, and why they should hire you. Now that you're prepared to answer your interviewer's questions, make sure you prepared a few questions of your own. Asking questions during an interview is really important. It's a way to demonstrate that you're you've invested time learning about the company and the job opening, and it shows that you're approaching the job thoughtfully. While you don't want to overwhelm your employer with too many questions, it's good to have at least three in mind or written down before you start the interview. You might think of more questions organically over the course of the interview, but having a few prepared will ensure that you're able to show that you're approaching the job thoughtfully. If your research doesn't lead you to think of questions, here are a few options for you. What does growth look like within this company? What qualities does your ideal candidate have? What's your favorite thing about working here? What do you see as the biggest challenge for someone in this position? How do you measure success for this position? As you write your questions, avoid ones that can be easily answered by a careful reading of the job description or other basic research. Asking a question that's already been answered for you can make it seem like you didn't prepare enough for the interview. Now that we've covered how to prepare your questions, let's talk about a few ways you can prepare your physical self for the interview. Remember, every decision you make early on in the process is a decision that you don't have to focus on in the hours and minutes leading up to your interview. Decide what you want to wear. If you can do a little research about the company dress code, it's probably better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed for your interview. Choose an outfit and styling that makes you feel comfortable and confident and make sure the clothes you choose are clean and in great condition well before your interview. This advice also applies if you'll be interviewing remotely. What you wear matters and issues like wrinkled clothing may be even more apparent on camera. Prepare mentally by reading over your resume several times so that you know backwards and forwards. You may want to print out a copy to keep with you during the interview itself. If your interview will take place online, you'll need to prepare the space where you'll take the video call. Choose the most private quiet space available. Take care that your background isn't too busy or distracting. Make sure it doesn't reveal anything personal that you might not want to share, having an unmade bed behind you, might make your presentation memorable but it won't necessarily give the impression you're hoping for. If you need to take your interview from a private space such as a bedroom, be sure to learn in advance how to blur your background. Finally, be sure to let other people know who share your space when your presentation will take place and ask them for support like childcare if you need it. Remember to turn your phones ring or off and take steps to limit any other potential distractions. Interviewing is a skill. Like any other skill, the more you practice, the better you become. Mock interviews allow you to practice answering questions smoothly and make a great impression on your interviewer. In this section, we'll cover the things you should prepare to make the most out of your mock interview. I'll show you how to answer questions clearly and effectively. Give you tips for holding your mock interviews and tell you about a new Google tool that uses machine learning to practice interviewing on your own. One of the most helpful ways to practice your interviewing skills is to hold a mock interview. It might feel a little odd at first, but having a friend, coworker or family member stand in for your interviewer will allow you to prepare your answers and notice where your interview skills may need some polishing. Ask someone who's a penny in your trust to join you for a mock interview. In return, you can switch roles and interview them if they need the practice. Doing a mock interview virtually can help you to get ahead of any technical problems and notice whether you need to make any adjustments to your setup. Whether your mock interview is in person or remote, you'll also get feedback on the clarity and effectiveness of your answers. If your interview will be held online, find out what video conferencing app or software your interviewer will use so you can practice on that exact one. Before your mock interview, prepare answers to questions you'll likely be asked. Look through the job description for clues about the qualities you need to embody to be hired for that job. This slide includes an example of a job listing with keywords you might want to highlight, like relationship building, communication and success metrics. Once you have a list of the qualities your interviewer will most likely be looking for, think of ways to demonstrate that you possess those skills. Think about times you've shown those skills or qualities in your career and go through your resume to remind yourself of times you demonstrated those qualities. You'll want to work those into the conversation during your interview. Whenever possible, you specific examples during your interview. Specificity is powerful. Sharing a brief story or experience about yourself is more impactful than simply telling someone you possess certain qualities. For example, if you're asked about sales skills, it's better to say I sold an average of five witches per day, which was the most on my team than to say I'm great at sales. Remember it's important that the interviewer gives a full picture of you and your capabilities, so don't hold back in talking about what you've accomplished. Let them know you're a good fit for the job by sharing your experiences. You can revisit the star approach we touched on when we introduce behavioral interview questions. Think of two to three accomplishments and practice describing the situation, making clear what tasks you were directly responsible for, providing details about the actions you took, and including tangible results. Google has created a free online tool that can help you to prepare to make your best impression during interviews, whether or not you have someone to do mock interviews with. Here's a video about the interview warm-up tool. There are more than 1.3 million job openings in the US than fast growing, high-paying fields like IT support, UX design, project management, and data analytics. So Google started the career certificate program, but one thing that learners had hard time with was interviewing. So we tried to think, could we use technology to build a tool to help you practice for a job interview. Interview warm-up is very easy to use. You're presented with spoken questions, and then we transcribe what you're saying and analyze your answers, trying where you repeat a word or where it's useful to use key terms. The goal is to create the safe space where you could practice as many times as you like. A great fit for this role. I learned a job as a technology manager with the NFL. And we can say this guy's a limit, but honestly at this point is a whole different status fit. The right side of the slide shows three sample questions from interview warm-up tool. What are you looking for in your next job? What are your career goals for the next five years? And when do you try to push through and solve a problem on your own and when do you involve others on your team? There are especially design practice questions for the fields of data analytics, e-commerce, IT support, project management, and UX design. Or you can just select general interview to practice for another field. To try this tool on your own, visit grow.google.bacslash certificates, backslash, interview, dash, warm-up. Now you know how to prepare and practice for your interview. Those steps are important because they will support you in being centered and focused on your conversation with your interviewer. Instead of being distracted by your technical setup or worrying about what to say, you'll be able to give all your attention to the person or people conducting the interview. Being fully present will allow you to show up as your best self. In this section, we'll talk about a few ways to do that. Whether it's in-person or online, the minutes leading up to your interview can sometimes produce a lot of anxiety. People have lots of different reactions to a job interview, particularly for a job they really want to land. Maybe your adrenaline starts pumping or your mouth goes dry. Whatever your reaction is, take a moment to notice and acknowledge it without passing judgment on yourself. Take a breath. Since you put time and energy into your preparation and practice, you will be ready. In the minutes before your interview, take the time to remind yourself about two or three things you want to make sure your interviewer is now by the end of the interview. If you're doing your interview remotely, you can have those things written on a sticky note nearby. Just make sure you don't look at it too frequently during the interview. Here are a few examples of things you might want your interviewers to come away with. I'm enthusiastic. I'm detail-oriented. I doubled sales for my team last year. I care deeply about the issue this nonprofit works on. I'm a team player. I have a great work ethic. I'm a people person and I embrace tough problems. If you notice yourself losing focus or feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to really see the people in front of you. Refocus your attention on the people you're speaking with. Getting curious about the people you're talking to, about the position, and about the company can be a great way to stop yourself from overthinking or getting too nervous. Your curiosity can help you connect with your interviewers. Remember, they're not the only ones trying to determine whether you're a good fit for the job. You are also trying to decide whether you want to work with them. Remember to periodically take moments to breathe throughout your interview. A deep breath is always available to you if you need to calm down, gather your thoughts or center yourself. You can mute yourself if you don't want your interviewer to hear you taking deep breaths during the interview. Here are a few other things to consider to help you to relax during your interview. Interviewers want you to do great. Nothing makes them happier than meeting someone who's great for a role. If this role isn't for you, the next one might be. Now you have a connection that a company that interests you. Think of the interview as a time to celebrate the things you've accomplished in your career and meet people who may be able to help you to take your career to the next level. We've made it through prepare, practice, and be present. Now let's take a few moments to go through some questions that come up for many people who are getting ready to interview for a new job. Job searchers often wonder how to handle interview questions about breaks and their employment. If at any point in your career you've taken more than a few months off, you'll have a gap in your resume. Resume gaps are far more common than you might think. Many people have extended periods of unemployment. Others have take a time off to raise children, care for a family member, or for any number of personal reasons. Sometimes they'll have a break in employment because of a layoff during an economic downturn. A gap in your resume is no reason to avoid applying for a job. Just be prepared to discuss it with the recruiter or hiring manager. If you spent your time away from work doing any volunteer work, taking classes, or getting other valuable skills, go ahead and mention those in your resume. If your resume gap is for a more sensitive reason like being out of work for an extended period of time or taking care of a health issue, practice sharing that information in a smooth, neutral way. You don't have to reveal too much. You can also be proactive and simply explain your resume gap in your job application or a cover letter. If you're new to the workforce, you may not have had a lot of job history to discuss in your interview. That's okay. Everybody had a first job, which they had to get without an official work experience. If you've been called into an interview, your potential employer has already seen your resume, so they'll know your background. In order to help the conversation flow, think about relevant experiences you can share in your interview, volunteer work, internships, schoolwork, extracurriculars, or other valuable personal experiences. Depending on the job, you might even bring up family situations that touch you things you might apply to the job. For example, if you're applying for a job to help run an after-school program, you could talk about babysitting your siblings and cousins. If you're applying for a job in sales or marketing, you can talk about your experience doing sales for a school or charity fundraiser. Even if you don't have any experiences that relate directly to the job you're applying for, you can talk about when and why you became interested in that job or field. If you don't have prior work experience to discuss in an interview, remember that your life experiences led you to apply for this job and has given you some knowledge that you can bring to the workforce. Let's fast forward a few steps. Your preparation and practice gave you the confidence to complete your job interview and make a great impression. Congratulations. Now let's talk about the steps that you can take to make that impression last and hopefully earn a job offer. The image on this slide shows a thank you email. A thank you note is one extra chance to leave a positive impression on your interviewer and hiring team. So be sure to send a thank you note via email within 24 hours to everyone you spoke with. The hiring manager, the recruiter and any other team members. Your thank you note where email should be brief, no more than four or five sentences. In your email, be sure to thank the person for taking the time to interview you. Infocise how enthusiastic you are about the job. Be specific about what you like about the position and what you're excited to potentially contribute to their team. If you can mention one specific thing you enjoyed speaking to them about. Even if you had a conversation about your favorite sports team or restaurant, those moments of connection can pave the way for a professional relationship. Be sure to prove read your note carefully and complete a spelling and grammar check. Today we discuss the ways you can give an interview that leaves a great impression with a potential employer. We discuss the three piece. Prepare, practice and be present. During the prepare stage, you do your research, then prep your physical space, equipment and self. In practice, you rehearse out loud and get feedback from someone you trust or from the interview warm up tool. Finally, to be present, you focus on the main things you want to get across in your interview. You breathe to center yourself and you use curiosity to connect with your interviewers. I hope that you'll be able to approach your future interviews with confidence and even find ways to enjoy them as learning opportunities and as chances to grow your career. In addition to potentially helping you get a new job, interviews can also be a great opportunity to meet new people and learn more about an industry that interests you.

This wraps up the presentation portion of today's workshop. Now give us just a few moments to pass off to Beseen who will answer some of the questions you submitted. Thanks, Anna. Hey, everyone. I'm Beseen, and I'm excited to answer a few of the questions that you've asked throughout today's session. As usual, we've actually received quite a few of them. I remember if we don't get to answer your questions, we'll have to be going back in and answer all of them on the growth Google on their page below the virtual event shortly after it includes. All right, so let's get on to our first question. It is from Billy. Billy wants to know, how do I avoid the nerves, the nerves when going into an interview? That is a great question, Billy, and really it's all about preparation, right? So grab a friend, a family member, to ask you some of the common questions you get in interviews so that you'll feel prepared for anything you might be asked. Next, you want to then try to avoid stuff that's going to make you nervous during the interview process, like drinking too much caffeine, like maybe you were tired and you drink too much caffeine out of your jeanery. And also try things like exercise, maybe some yoga before the interview so that you've got a sense of calmness before that happens and before the interview and you'll be able to be more focused. Or even try things like we go out to whether it's a virtual interview or even in person, things like the power stance before that interview really just helps you to get focus, build that confidence before going in. All right, so next question here is from David. David wants to know how to answer questions on weaknesses. And so that's a great question, David. And really it's something that you can spend in your favor. Like people think weaknesses is a bad thing. But if you approach it right away and spin it in your favor, you can like always introduce your weaknesses as areas that I am currently working with improving, right? And then list out that plan of action and how you're actually going to improve that that weakness. And then if you go about it that way, regardless of you always will make it sound like that weakness is actually a strength that you're currently building. All right, next question here is from Donna and Donna wants to know when a question comes up such as why did you leave your last job, order some red flags that signal to the interviewer that the job candidates answer is not fit to continue on the next stage for the interview process. And then so, because we're not going to a great question, Donna. And then so the thing you want to do mainly is you want to always avoid any answers that include speaking negatively about your past company. You want to remember that your new potential employer will look at your behavior in relation to how you might have behaved with your past employees, right? And so the last thing you want to do is you know, hire someone that has had negative things to say about, you know, their past company. And then maybe if they leave their company has negative things to say about their company. Also, you want to avoid situations where you discuss conflict that could be misconstrued as you simply not wanting to collaborate or work with others in your previous jobs. All right, next question here is from Marvin. Marvin wants to know what's the best way to receive feedback after an interview. And it's a good question, Marvin. And you can usually solicit feedback via email, right? That's a really easy way to do that. So let's feedback the email. One thing you want to do is keep it short and sweet. So one question and you can always use different questions if you're fine, that you're not you find interaction on multiple interviews. You can either use same question or multiple questions. Just to really kind of get a feel overall around where you know, some errors and improvement. If you don't have access to their email address, you can always find that contact via LinkedIn. LinkedIn's a great place to find people contact reach out and get that question answered. All right, next question here is from Olivia. Olivia wants to know what's the best way to remember good examples of times that I've done XYZ when those come up in behavioral interview questions. And then so great question Olivia. And behavioral interviews, often times interview will ask for a very specific situation example from like your work experience. In the moment, it can be really difficult to remember your best examples. So they're really prep for this. You want to keep a running list of all of these good examples and something like a Google Doc, right? So then prior to an interview, you want to practice explaining these situations out loud, right? And then they'll be fresh in your memory. This is also something you can do with a family member or a friend. Next question here is from Nicole. Nicole wants to know when is the CFAS method used and when is the star method used? So we're talking about CFAS and star. They're very similar approaches to behavioral interview questions. So CFAS is typically used to answer a hypothetical situation like something that you've actually haven't been in before to highlight how you would approach that situation. As opposed to star, it is used more when you've actually been in that situation and you can discuss the actions you took and the actual results that came about of those actions. All right, next question here is from Al. Al wants to know how can you justify you have transferable skills, meaning you can do other things, not just the activities directly, in your previous roles. So hey Al, right? It's not about justifying the skills you have. It's really about sharing what you actually bring to the table and you want to share that with confidence, right? So ultimately it's up to the interviewer to decide whether or not you bring more to the table than the other candidates. So your transferable skills may actually outshine one prospect, but another prospect may have more desirable skills for that particular role. So sell it, sell yourself and just let them know what you bring to the table. Next question here is from Sam. Sam wants to know how to address career gap while talking. Great question, Sam. This is a very popular question we get. And really addressing the career gap is as simple as explaining what you were doing during this gap in your resume, right? It's really, you know, you could be maybe you were laid off and having a hard time finding a job. Maybe you're helping the level and maybe you were traveling the world. Whatever it is, it's really important to, number one, you know, have this kind of rehearse and prepared. So you know, this might be a question might come up. What is my explanation? Don't wait until someone asks you that question in interview. And the other thing is you want to be completely 100% honest. You are sitting in front of a person who sees you as a potential fit for their company. A career gap is not going to be the deal breaker for you in this situation. Just explain what it was. Why you have the gap whether it was good or bad, but the key is you want to be prepared, concise and with a well rehearsed answer. All right. Last question here is from Steven. Steven wants to know how to answer the question about expected salary. If you apply for like the junior position, should I say the lowest one? So good question, Steven. One of the things you know, salary shouldn't really be a topic of discussion during the interview as the salary should have already been included with the original job post. Like so, like with that said, if salary does become part of the discussion, you should never undersell yourself. So really understand what you're worth and always ask for that. And then from there, you can negotiate salary from that point. But never necessarily sell yourself always going, but it really shouldn't be a part of that discussion. All right. So this wraps up the Q&A portion for today. Thank you all for joining us for your job. Your next job interview. Hopefully everyone learned something new.

WHAT IS A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT?
A retirement account lets you set aside money pre-tax from each paycheck so you can use it later in life. ""Pre-tax"" is money you earn before taxes are deducted, so you get to keep more of your paycheck. Many employers offer different types of retirement accounts and you can also open an individual account. Scroll down to learn about your options for saving for retirement! If you take the quiz at the end of the page, you'll enter a raffle to win $100!
RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS VS. SAVINGS ACCOUNTS!
There are many differences between retirement accounts & savings accounts. The major difference between both of them is this: Retirement accounts are a way to grow your money, while savings accounts are a way to preserve it.
SAVINGS ACCOUNTS
Interest-bearing account that gives you easy access to money (cash) for short-term and emergency needs and goals. They don't offer any tax benefits, nor do they have the same potential for growth.
Good place to keep ready cash (i.e., emergency fund) or money for short-term goals (i.e., summer vacation, new car, etc.)
Safe place to keep money temporarily (i.e., proceeds from a home sale) before investing it elsewhere.
NO LIMIT TO AMOUNT DEPOSITED: The money you contribute to it is available at any time & for any reason with NO PENALTIES. You make deposits to a savings account at your own pace & there's no limit on how much you can deposit. You can withdraw money up to the allowed number of times per month, without any tax penalties.
The money stays as cash; it's not invested at all so you can access it very easily.
RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS
Tax-advantaged account that is specifically created to help people reach their long-term goal(s) of having enough money to retire comfortably.
Can also be used for emergency funds.
INVESTMENTS: stocks, mutual funds, bonds, and CDs
LIMIT TO CONTRIBUTIONS
You are only supposed to make withdrawals later in life; you will pay tax penalties if you want to withdraw money before then
401(K) AND 403(B) RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS
WHAT IS A 401(K)?
A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement account that offers some big tax advantages. But there are some drawbacks you should know before deciding to invest. This video discusses two types of 401(k) plans: traditional 401(k) and Roth 401(k). It goes on to explain the tax advantages of both plans, limitations of 401(k) plans, employer matching benefits, and types of investments offered by 401(k) plans.
WHAT IS A 403(B)?
A 403(b) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan for employees of government agencies, non-profit organizations, and other 501(c)(3) non-profit employers. This video covers the following information:
What is a 403(b), and who can contribute to one?
What are the tax advantages and contributions of a 403(b)?
What are 403(b) Roth options and other additional features of 403(b) accounts?
401(K) AND 403(B): SIMILARITIES & DIFFERENCES
SIMILARITIES BETWEEN 401(K) AND 403(B)
This video explains some similairities between 401k accounts and 403b accounts: maximum contributions, pre-tax contributions, employer matching contributions, and withdrawals to name a few.
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 401(K) AND 403(B)
The most common retirement accounts are 401(k) and the 403(b). While there are similarities between both accounts, there are also differences between them. This video explains some of the differences between them.
INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNT (IRA)
If your employer does not offer a 401k or 403b, an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is something you can open on your own. Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) allow you to make tax-deferred investments to provide financial security when you retire. The most common types of IRAs are traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.
SIMILARITIES BETWEEN TRADITIONAL IRAs & ROTH IRAs
Similarities include the following:
Both offer tax advantages.
Both allow contributions of $5,500 a year under age 50 and $6,500 over age 50.
Both allow a broad range of investments, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, annuities, etc.
Possible penalties can be imposed if funds are taken out improperly before age 59.
The saver's tax credit is available for anyone who makes contributions to their IRA (both traditional and/or Roth IRA).
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TRADITIONAL IRAs & ROTH IRAs
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TRADITIONAL IRAS & ROTH IRAS
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) can help you pay less in taxes when you’re investing for retirement. This video explores the differences between two types of retirement accounts: traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.

IRA Distributions
The required minimum distribution (RMD) is the minimum $ amount that you MUST withdraw from your account each year after you turn 70 or 72 (this does NOT apply to Roth IRAs). Click on the ""Required Minimum Distribution"" button to learn about the RMD rules for IRAs. You can also click the ""IRA Distributions"" button to read more about the distribution rules for IRAs.

IRA Contributions are annual $ amounts that you're allowed to make to your IRA. Click on the ""IRA Contributions"" button to learn more.
HOW TO SIGN UP FOR A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT
Decide how much money you need when you retire, which is usually around 65 years old. You can enter your income, age and other info here to estimate how much you need to save for retirement.
Open a retirement account through your employer if they offer one. Keep your eyes peeled for an email from HR asking how much you'd like to contribute from your paycheck toward retirement. This amount is usually a percentage of your paycheck and is taken out before taxes.
If your employer offers matching contributions, it means that they'll contribute the same amount you do to your retirement account. For example, if you contribute 5% of your paycheck and that's $100, your employer will also contribute $100 for a total of $200 going toward retirement each paycheck.
Open a retirement account on your own if your employer doesn't offer one. You can go to the website of a retirement account provider like Fidelity or Interactive Brokers, choose whether you want to open a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, fill out your personal information, and decide how you want to fund your retirement account. Funding your account usually involves automatically transferring money from your bank account to your retirement account on a biweekly or monthly basis.
